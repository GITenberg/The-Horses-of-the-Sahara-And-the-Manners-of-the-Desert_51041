</div>
<p class='c005'>In this English version of General Daumas' justly
eulogised work on the Horses of the Sahara and the
Manners of the Desert, two or three entire chapters,
besides many isolated passages, have been omitted,
which treated either of veterinary science or of matters
little suited to the taste of general readers in this country.
Part the second, which was so strangely overlooked by
the critics of the last French edition, will be found
extremely interesting to all who love the chace and can
appreciate a life of adventure. The description of the
sports and pastimes, the manners and customs of the
aristocracy of the African Desert, is especially worthy of
perusal; nor will the quaint remarks of the once famous
Emir Abd-el-Kader fail to command very general respect
and sympathy.</p>

    <div class='c001'>THE HORSES OF THE SAHARA</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='chapter'>
  <a id='Page_3'></a>
  <h2 class='c004'>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>The horsemen of Numidia were famous even in the
time of the Romans. The Arab horsemen are in no way
inferior to their predecessors. The horse has continued
down to these our days to be the chief instrument of war
among those martial tribes. A dissertation on the horses
of Algeria, which still retain the typical characteristics of
both the Barb and the Arab stock, is not only of interest
for the lovers of horse-flesh, but also for those who are
responsible for the maintenance of our power in Algeria.
The greatest merit of a study of this kind is its perfect
accuracy as to facts. I will therefore mention the sources
whence I have derived my information.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the course of the sixteen years which I have passed
in Africa, I have been intrusted with missions or have
exercised functions which brought me into constant
intercourse with the Arabs, a people hitherto so little
known, but whom we are bound to study if we would
learn how to govern them.</p>

<p class='c009'>From 1837 to 1839 I was the French Consul at Mascara
accredited to the Emir Abd-el-Kader; after that, head of
the Arab Office in the province of Oran, in which at that
<a id='Page_4'></a>time General Lamoricière held the chief military command;
and finally Central Director of the Arab Office of
Algeria under the government of Marshal the Duke of
Isly. These different posts brought me into close contact
with the native chiefs and the first families of the country.
I acquired their language and it was through their
assistance that I was enabled to publish, one after the
other, my books on the Algerian Sahara, the Great
Desert, Great Kabylia, and on the Manners and Customs
of Algeria, works which may perchance have rendered
some service to French interests by throwing light upon
important questions of war, commerce and government.</p>

<p class='c009'>The study of the Arab horse, which had long been the
subject of my most careful researches, seemed to me to
form the natural complement of my previous labours.
Indeed, this question, full of uncertainty and contradictions,
was as it still is, of the most thrilling interest. In
the event of a European war must we always have
recourse to foreign countries, or cannot Algeria come
to our aid in supplying remounts for our light cavalry?
Such was the national question I set before myself, and
the reply to which I founded on patient and minute
inquiries throughout my long residence in Algeria.</p>

<p class='c009'>Besides, according to some authorities, the Arabs
are the first horsemen in the world, while according to
others they butcher their horses. The former give them
credit for whatever is good in the systems pursued by
ourselves or our neighbours; while the latter insist that
they know nothing whatever about riding, or about the
veterinary art, or about breeding. How much of truth
is there in all this? What is the real value of Arab
horses? What is the nature of the service they are capable
<a id='Page_5'></a>of rendering? This I was determined to find out,
not by hearsay, but through the evidence of my own
eyes—not from books, but from men. What I am now
about to place before the reader is consequently the result
both of my own personal observations, and also of conversations
with Arabs of every grade of life, from the
tented chief down to the simple horseman, who, as he
himself would say in his picturesque idiom, has no other
profession than to "live by his spurs." In other words, I
made my inquiries of those who had large possessions,
and of those who had very little; of those who bred
horses, and of those who only knew how to ride them:
in short, of every body. Thus the opinions which I am
about to commit to paper do not emanate from the head
of a single individual—they are gathered separately
from the members of a powerful tribe. My only merit is
that of having collected and arranged many documents
widely scattered and difficult to obtain.</p>

<p class='c009'>In fact, a Christian has need to employ both tact
and patience to extract from Mussulmans information
insignificant perhaps in itself, but which a gloomy fanaticism
makes them regard as of great importance, or as
perilous to their religion. Nevertheless, I have one
reservation to make. I am not at all prepared to say:
"This is right," or "That is wrong." I say simply:
"Right or wrong, this is what the Arabs do."</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c000'>
    <div>REMARKS OF THE EMIR ABD-EL-KADER.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Learned Mussulmans have written upon horses a great
number of books in which they discourse at considerable
<a id='Page_6'></a>length upon their qualities, their colours, upon all that
is esteemed beneficial or injurious, their maladies and
the right mode of treatment. One of them, Abou-Obeïda,
a contemporary of the son of Haroun-al-Raschid, composed
no fewer than fifty volumes on the horse. This
Abou-Obeïda met with a little misadventure, which
shows that it is not the author of the most ponderous
and numerous volumes who imparts the soundest information,
and that not the worst plan is to consult men
themselves.</p>

<p class='c009'>"How many books hast thou written upon the horse?"
asked one day of a celebrated Arab poet the vizir of
Mamoun, son of Haroun-al-Raschid. "Only one." Then
turning to Abou-Obeïda he put to him the same question.
"Fifty," replied he. "Rise, then," said the vizir, "go up
to that horse and repeat the name of every part of his
frame, taking care to point out the position of each."
"I am not a veterinary surgeon," answered Abou-Obeïda.
"And thou?" said the vizir to the poet.</p>

<p class='c009'>"Upon that"—it is the poet himself who relates the
anecdote—"I rose from my seat, and taking the animal
by the forelock, I began to name one part after the other,
placing my hand upon each to indicate its position, and
at the same time recited all the poetic allusions, all the
sayings and proverbs of the Arabs referring to it. When
I had finished, the vizir said to me: "Take the horse."
I took it, and if ever I wished to annoy Abou-Obeïda, I
rode this animal on my way to visit him."</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <a id='Page_7'></a>
  <h2 class='c004'>ON THE ORIGIN OF THE ARAB HORSE.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>In all times the horse has been regarded by peoples and
Governments as one of the most potent elements of their
strength and prosperity. At the present day there is no
question relating either to rural economy or to the art of
war, more canvassed than that touching the amelioration
of the charger. The highest authorities of the State,
learned societies, agriculturists, the army, every body,
in short, is taken up with it in France, and yet we are
very far from being agreed upon it. For my own part,
I have never wearied of studying that noble animal, from
taste quite as much as from patriotism or professional
necessity. I have consulted the most esteemed authors
and men of great erudition, but I confess that it is among
the Arabs I have met with the most just and practical
appreciations of the subject. To obtain the best possible
information, I have frequently applied to the Emir Abd-el-Kader,
that illustrious chief who, by reason of his
exalted position in Mussulman society, his science, and
his skill as a horseman, was of all men the most competent
to remove the misgivings which still troubled me.
The following is the last letter that he wrote to me in
<a id='Page_8'></a>reply to certain questions I had proposed to him as to
the origin of the Arab horse. It seems to me to contain
some very remarkable suggestions, even from a zoological
point of view. In any case it is sufficiently curious
to justify my expectation that it will prove acceptable to
all who, whether at home or abroad, feel an interest in
the equine race.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c000'>
    <div>LETTER OF THE EMIR ABD-EL-KADER.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Praise be to the one God!</p>

<p class='c010'>To him who remains ever the same amidst the revolutions of
this world:</p>

<p class='c010'>To our friend, General Daumas.</p>

<p class='c010'>Peace be with you, through the mercy and blessing of Allah,
on the part of the writer of this letter, on that of his mother, his
children, their mother, of all the members of his family and of
all his associates.</p>

<p class='c010'>To proceed: I have read your questions, I address to you my
answers.</p>

<p class='c010'>You ask me for information as to the origin of the Arab
horse. You are like unto a fissure in a land dried up by the sun,
and which no amount of rain, however abundant, will ever be
able to satisfy.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nevertheless, to quench, if possible, your thirst (for knowledge)
I will this time go back to the very head of the fountain.
The stream is there always the freshest and most pure.</p>

<p class='c010'>Know then that among us it is admitted that Allah created the
horse out of the wind, as he created Adam out of mud.</p>

<p class='c010'>This cannot be questioned. Several prophets—peace be with
them!—have proclaimed what follows:</p>

<p class='c010'>When Allah willed to create the horse, He said to the south
wind:</p>

<p class='c010'>"I will that a creature should proceed from thee—condense
thyself!"—and the wind condensed itself. Then came the Angel
Gabriel, and he took a handful of this matter and presented it to
Allah, who formed of it a dark bay or a dark chestnut horse,
(<i>koummite</i>—red mingled with black) saying:</p>

<p class='c010'><a id='Page_9'></a>"I have called thee horse (<i>frass</i>); I have created thee Arab,
and I have bestowed upon thee the colour <i>koummite</i>. I have
attached good fortune to the hair that falls between thy eyes.
Thou shalt be the lord (<i>sid</i>) of all other animals. Men shall follow
thee wheresoever thou goest. Good for pursuit as for flight,
thou shalt fly without wings. Upon thy back shall riches repose,
and through thy means shall wealth come."</p>

<p class='c010'>Then He signed him with the sign of glory and of good
fortune (<i>ghora</i>, a star in the middle of the forehead).</p>

<p class='c010'>Do you now wish to know if Allah created the horse before
man, or if He created man before the horse? Listen:</p>

<p class='c010'>Allah created the horse before man, and the proof is that man
being the superior creature, Allah would naturally give unto
him all that he would require before creating himself.</p>

<p class='c010'>The wisdom of Allah points out that He made all that is upon
the earth for Adam and his posterity.</p>

<p class='c010'>Here is another testimony to that:</p>

<p class='c010'>When Allah had created Adam, He called him by his name and
said unto him:</p>

<p class='c010'>"Choose between the horse and <i>Borak</i>."<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c011'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Adam answered: "The fairest of the two is the horse," and
Allah replied:</p>

<p class='c010'>"It is well; thou hast chosen thy glory and the eternal glory
of thy children; so long as they shall exist, my blessing shall
be upon them, for I have created nothing that is more dear to
me than man and the horse."</p>

<p class='c010'>Likewise Allah created the horse before the mare. My proof
is that the male is more noble than the female, and he is, besides
more vigourous and potent. Though they are both of the very
same species, the one is more impassioned than the other, and
the Divine Power is wont to create the stronger of the two the
first. What the horse most yearns after is the combat and the
race. He is also preferable to the mare for the purposes of war
because he is more fleet and patient of fatigue, and because he
shares his rider's emotions of hatred or tenderness. It is not so
with the mare. Let a horse and a mare receive exactly the
same sort of wound, and one that is sure to be fatal, the horse
will bear up against it until he has succeeded in carrying his
<a id='Page_10'></a>master far from the field of battle; while the mare, on the
contrary, will sink at once upon the spot, without any force of
resistance. There is not a doubt on the subject—it is a fact
known by proof among the Arabs. I have seen frequent instances
of it in our combats, and have experienced it myself.</p>

<p class='c010'>This being granted, let us pass on to another point. Did Allah
create the Arab horse before the foreign horse, or did he create
the foreign horse before the Arab?</p>

<p class='c010'>As a consequence of my former argument every thing leads us
to believe that He created the Arab before all others, because he
is without dispute the most noble. Besides, the foreign horse is
only a species of a genus, and the Almighty has in no case created
the species before the genus.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now whence come the Arab horses of the present day?</p>

<p class='c010'>It is related by many historians that after the time of Adam,
the horse—like all other animals, such as the gazelle, the
ostrich, the buffalo, and the ass—lived in a wild state. According
to these writers the first man who, after Adam, mounted the
horse was Ishmael, the father of the Arabs. He was the son of
our lord Abraham, beloved of Allah. Allah taught him to call
the horses, and when he did so, they all came galloping up to
him. He then took possession of the finest and most spirited, and
broke them in.</p>

<p class='c010'>But after a while many of the animals trained and employed
by Ishmael lost something of their purity. One single stock was
preserved in all its nobleness by Solomon, the son of David, and
it is that which is called <i>Zad-el-Rakeb</i> (the gift, the support of
the horseman), whence all real Arabs derive their origin in this
manner.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is a tradition that some Arabs of the Azed tribe went up
to Jerusalem the Noble to congratulate Solomon on his marriage
with the Queen of Saba. Having fulfilled their mission they
addressed him as follows:</p>

<p class='c010'>"O Prophet of Allah! our country is far distant, and our provisions
are exhausted: thou art a great king; bestow upon us
wherewithal to take us home."</p>

<p class='c010'>Solomon thereupon gave orders to bring from his stables a
magnificent stallion descended from the Ishmael stock, and then
dismissed them with these words:</p>

<p class='c010'>"Behold the provisions which I bestow upon you for your
journey. When hunger assails you, gather fuel, light a fire,
<a id='Page_11'></a>place your best rider on this horse and arm him with a stout
lance. Hardly will you have collected your wood and kindled
a flame, when you will see him return with the produce of a
successful chase. Go and may Allah cover you with his blessing."</p>

<p class='c010'>The Azed took their departure. At their first halt they did as
Solomon had prescribed, and neither zebra, nor gazelle, nor
ostrich could escape them. Thus enlightened as to the value of
the animal presented to them by the son of David, these Arabs
on their return home devoted him to foal-getting, and carefully
selecting the dams, at length obtained the breed to which out of
gratitude they gave the name of <i>Zad-el-Rakeb</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>This is the stock whose high renown spread at a later period
through the whole world.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c011'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>In fact it was propagated both in the East and the West in the
train of the Arabs who subsequently penetrated to the limits of
the habitable globe. Long previous to Islam, Hamir-Aben-Melouk
and his descendants reigned for a hundred years over the West.
It was he who founded Medina and Saklia.</p>

<p class='c010'>Shedad-Eben-Aâd made himself master of the whole country
to the borders of Moghreb, and built cities and constructed sea
ports.</p>

<p class='c010'>Afrikes, who gave his name to Africa, extended his conquests
as far as Tandja (Tangiers), while his son Shamar overran the
East as far as China, forced his way into the city of Sad,
and destroyed it. On that account that place has ever since
been called Shamar-Kenda,—because <i>kenda</i> in Persian signifies
"he has destroyed",—which the Arabs have corrupted into
Samar-Kand.</p>

<p class='c010'>Since the introduction of Islamism, new Mussulman invasions
extended the fame of Arab horses to Italy, Spain, and even to
France, where, without doubt, they have left traces of their blood.
But the event which more than any other filled Africa with Arab
horses, was the invasion of Sidi-Okba, and still later the successive
invasions of the fifth, and sixth centuries after the Hijra. Under
Sidi-Okba the Arabs merely encamped in Africa, whereas in the
fifth and sixth centuries they arrived as colonists with the intention
of settling there with their wives and families, their horses
<a id='Page_12'></a>and mares. It was these latter invasions which established Arab
tribes on the soil of Algeria, particularly the Mehall, the Djendel,
the Oulad-Mahdi, the Douaouda, etc., who spread themselves in
all directions and founded the true nobility of the country. These
same invasions transplanted the Arab horse into the Soudan, and
justify our asserting the oneness of the Arab stock, whether in
Algeria or in the East.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus, the history of the Arab horse may be divided into four
great epochs: 1st from Adam to Ishmael; 2nd from Ishmael to
Solomon; 3rd from Solomon to Mohammed; 4th from Mohammed
to our own times.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is to be clearly understood, however, that the race of the
principal epoch, that of Solomon, having been forcibly divided
into several branches, different varieties have been formed partly
from the change of climate, and partly from the greater or less
degree of care bestowed upon them, precisely as is the case with
mankind. The colour of the coat has also varied under the
influence of the same circumstances. Experience has satisfied
the Arabs that in districts where the ground is stony, the usual
colour is gray, and in those where the ground is chalky (<i>Ard
Beda</i>), white is the prevalent hue. I have myself frequently
verified these observations.</p>

<p class='c010'>There remains now only one question to settle with you. You
ask by what outward signs the Arabs recognize a horse to be
noble, a drinker of air. Here is my answer:</p>

<p class='c010'>The horse of pure descent is distinguished among us by the
thinness of its lips and of the interior cartilage of the nose, by
the dilation of its nostrils, by the leanness of the flesh encircling
the veins of the head, by the graceful manner the neck is
attached, by the softness of its coat, its mane, and the hairs of
its tail, by its breadth of chest, the largeness of its joints, and
the leanness of the extremities. According, however, to the traditions
of our ancestors the thoroughbred is still better known
by its moral characteristics than its physical peculiarities. The
outward signs will enable you to guess at the race, but it is by
the moral qualities alone you will receive full confirmation of the
extreme care displayed in coupling the sires and dams, and of
the pains taken to prohibit all misalliances.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thoroughbred horses have no vice. A horse is the most beautiful
of all animals, but his moral qualities, as we think, must
correspond with his physical, or he will be regarded as degenerate.
<a id='Page_13'></a>The Arabs are so convinced of this that if a horse, or a
mare, have given indisputable proof of extraordinary speed, of
remarkable endurance of hunger and thirst, of rare intelligence,
or of grateful affection for the hand that feeds them, they will
make every imaginable sacrifice to get their progeny, under the
persuasion that the points by which they were themselves distinguished
will reappear in their offspring.</p>

<p class='c010'>We allow, then, that a horse is really noble when in addition
to a fine configuration, he unites courage with fire, and bears
himself proudly in midst of battle and danger.</p>

<p class='c010'>Such a horse will love his master, and as a rule will suffer no
other person to mount him.</p>

<p class='c010'>He will not yield to the wants of nature so long as his master
is on his back.</p>

<p class='c010'>He will refuse to touch what another horse has left.</p>

<p class='c010'>He will take pleasure in troubling with his feet whatever
limpid water he may meet with.</p>

<p class='c010'>By the senses of hearing, of sight, and of smell, as well as by
his address and intelligence, he will know how to save his master
from the thousand accidents that may befall him in war or at
the chase.</p>

<p class='c010'>Finally, sharing the emotions of pain or pleasure experienced
by his rider, he will aid him in the combat by combating also,
and every where without hesitation will make common cause
with him (<i>ikatel-ma-Rakebhou</i>). Such are the tokens which
evidence purity of race.</p>

<p class='c010'>We possess numerous works on the characteristics of the
horse, whence it appears that, after man, he is the most noble,
the most patient, the most useful of created beings. He is content
with little, and if considered simply with regard to strength,
he is still superior to other animals. An ox of great strength
will carry a hundred-weight, but if you place it on his back he
will move only with an effort and be quite incapable of running.
On the other hand, the horse carries a full grown man, a robust
cavalier, with standard, arms, and ammunition, besides food for
both, and will go at speed for a whole day and more, without eating
or drinking. It is by his means that the Arab holds whatever
he possesses, rushes on his enemy, tracks him down or flees from
him, and defends his family and his freedom. Let him be enriched
with the possession of all that sweetens life, his horse
alone is his protector.</p>

<p class='c010'><a id='Page_14'></a>Do you now understand the boundless affection the Arabs feel
for their horses! It is only equalled by the services rendered by
the latter. To their horses they owe their joys, their triumphs,
and therefore are they prefered to gold and precious stones. In
the days of paganism they loved the animal from motives of interest
and merely because it procured them glory and wealth; but
when the Prophet spoke of it in terms of the highest praise, this
instinctive love was transfigured into a religious duty; some of
the first words he uttered on the subject of horses are those
ascribed to him by tradition, on the occasion of the arrival of
several tribes from Yemen with a view to accept his doctrines
and to present him, in token of submission, with five magnificent
mares belonging to the five different races of which Arabia then
boasted. It is said that Mohammed went forth from his tent to
receive the noble animals that had been sent to him, and caressing
them with his hand, expressed himself in these words:</p>

<p class='c010'>"Blessed be ye, O Daughters of the wind!"</p>

<p class='c010'>Afterward the Messenger of Allah (<i>Rassoul Allah</i>) said in
addition:</p>

<p class='c010'>"Whosoever keeps and trains a horse for the cause of Allah
is counted among those who give alms day and night, publicly
or in secret. He shall have his reward. All his sins shall be
remitted to him and never shall fear dishonour his heart."</p>

<p class='c010'>Now I pray unto Allah to grant you a happiness that shall
never pass away. Cherish your friendship for me. The wise
men among the Arabs have said:</p>

<p class='c010'>Riches may be lost:</p>

<p class='c010'>Honours are but a shadow that fades away:</p>

<p class='c010'>But true friends are a treasure that remains.</p>

<p class='c010'>He who hath written these lines with a hand which shall one
day be withered in death, is your friend, the pauper in the
presence of Allah.</p>

<p class='c010'>P. S. For the better understanding of our correspondence,
permit me to instruct you on one point. The word <i>ferass</i> is not
exclusively applied to the female of the horse, as is customary
in Algeria—it indicates the male as well as the female. If a
mare be particularly alluded to, it is necessary to say a female
<a id='Page_15'></a><i>ferass</i>; and in like manner if the allusion be to a horse, a male
<i>ferass</i> is the proper phrase. Such is the way with the true Arabs
(<i>Arabes-es-sahh</i>); strictly speaking, the mare is called <i>hadjra</i> and
the horse <i>hossan</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>The reader of this curious document will doubtless
have remarked the singular admixture of legendary
anecdotes with snatches of natural history sometimes
true, sometimes fabulous after the manner of Pliny and
Aristotle, and all of it under the dominion of a religious
sentiment. It is history as written by Orientals and
likewise by the Western Arabs; for both the one and the
other, until now outlawed as it were from progress by
their forced or voluntary exclusion from the intellectual
movement going on in Europe, are still, so far as
science and literature are concerned, no farther advanced
than their ancestors of Bagdad or Granada.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now, it is a remarkable fact that the more learned an
Arab may be, the more are his writings imbued with
that fancifulness which, for a reader accustomed to the
preciseness of our European style, needs to be cleared of
its poetical mysteriousness and constructed afresh, before
it can be reduced to the character of a document possessed
of any historical or scientific worth in the sense
we usually give to those words. Thus, at first sight,
the letter we have just perused is nothing more than a
fragment detached from an Oriental tale. There are,
nevertheless, lurking within it incontestable truths, and
from beneath the exaggerations and symbols of tradition
may be gathered information of a kind not wisely
to be despised. Here especially is it the letter that
killeth while the spirit giveth life—let us then seek for
the spirit beneath the letter.</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='Page_16'></a>God created the horse out of the wind, symbol of fleetness,
which, in the eyes of an Arab, is the first quality
of a courser. The poets of Greece were inspired by the
same idea. It was the wind that impregnated the mares
of Thessaly, the swiftest of ancient times; and it may
be that those mares were introduced into Greece from
Syria, or Arabia, together with the fabulous pedigree
assigned to them by the poets of both countries. If this
were the case, and here history is in accord with tradition,
the Arabian horses must have been, what they still
are on their native soil, the fleetest and best in the world.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Arabs, who neither understand nor practice our
system of fighting in compact and serried masses, at
times immovable, but who charge without any semblance
of order and see nothing disgraceful in a headlong flight,
are naturally disposed to love and to vaunt above all
others the drinker of air. "The air-drinker," say they,
"is the first in the combat to rush at the enemy; and the
first after victory to fly at the booty, and in case of defeat
the first to escape from danger."</p>

<p class='c009'>A poet has said: "There are things which an intelligent
King should never neglect. The first is a horse,
that by its swiftness shall be able to rescue him from
the enemy he has failed to overcome."</p>

<p class='c009'>The favourite steed of the Prophet was named <i>Ouskoub</i>,
"the torrent," from the word <i>sakab</i>, "quickly flowing
water." The intervention of the Angel Gabriel in the
creation of the horse commends that animal to the good
offices of the true Believers, for the Angel Gabriel is the
constant medium of communication between the Deity
and the Prophets, especially Mohammed. Now it was
by means and with the assistance of the horse alone that
<a id='Page_17'></a>the Mussulman tribes succeeded in accomplishing that
immense system of emigration, that propaganda war, as
far as China to the eastward, and westward to the Ocean,
which was in the mind of Mohammed to impose upon
them. It was indispensable, therefore, that the horse
should be looked upon in the light of a sacred animal, a
providential instrument of war, created by the Deity for
a special purpose, and of a nobler essence than that with
which He fashioned the other animals. To produce the
horse in a manner beyond the common law of creation,
to envelop his origin in a symbolism that wanders abroad
from natural history to lose itself in mysterious legends,
to place him thus beneath the safeguard of religious
reverence, evinced, as the result has proved, a thorough
knowledge of the spirit of the people upon whom Mohammed
purposed and was about to operate.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Koran in speaking of horses calls them <i>El-Kheir</i>,
"the especial treasure," and from this simple word the
commentators of the Sura, <i>sad</i>, have arrived at the
conclusion that "an Arab ought to love horses as a part of
his own heart, and to sacrifice for their keep the very
food of his own children." A volume might be composed
of phrases detached from the sacred book, or from the
<i>hadites</i> of the Prophet (his conversations as handed down
by tradition), and of the commentaries upon them, which
under the form of maxims and precepts, prescribe to
Mussulmans, as a religious duty, the love of horses. I
shall quote only a few of them.</p>

<p class='c009'>"Blessings, good fortune, and a rich booty shall be
attached to the forelock of horses until the day of the
resurrection." "Whoso keeps a horse for the holy war
in the way of the Most High, increases the number
<a id='Page_18'></a>of his good works. The hunger and thirst of such a
steed, the water he drinks, the food he eats, every one
of his hairs, each step he takes, and every function of
nature, shall all weigh in the balance at the day of the
last judgment."</p>

<p class='c009'>"The horse prays thrice a day. In the morning he
says: 'O Allah! make me beloved of my master.' At
noon: 'Do well by my master, that he may do well by
me.' In the evening: 'Grant that he may enter into
paradise upon my back!'"</p>

<p class='c009'>It was doubtless under the impression of these last
words that El-Doumayry wrote in his history of animals,
<i>Hayat-el-hayouan</i>: "The horse is the animal that by his
intelligence approaches nearest to man." While on this
subject I cannot help remarking that the Arabs, when
they advanced this proposition, were well acquainted
with the animals which pass with us as being the most
intelligent such as the elephant, the dog, etc. How is it
then? May it not be that the Arabs, by living on such
intimate terms with the horse, have succeeded in developing
faculties the very existence of which is unknown
to us, who accord to that animal only the instinct of
memory? With them, in fact, the horse is a friend of
the family. With us, on the contrary, it is no more
than an article of luxury or an instrument of labour,
which we are ever ready to change through interest or
caprice; as witness the common saying: "One does not
marry one's horse!" But the Arab does marry his horse.
Be this as it may, the maxims quoted above all tend to
the same end, to identify man with the horse. Let it
not be supposed, however, that that is all. It was necessary
that the horse should be the companion of the
<a id='Page_19'></a>Believer alone, to the exclusion of all infidels,—a dogma
the political hearing of which will be readily appreciated.
Allah hath said: "The horse shall be cherished by all
my servants, but he shall be the despair of all those who
do not follow my laws, and none will I place on his back
save those who know me and who worship me."</p>

<p class='c009'>It is needless to add that the Mussulman princes have
availed themselves of this dogma to prohibit in the name
of Allah the sale of Arab horses to Christians, under
pain of sin and damnation. These commands, though
of divine origin have, I am well aware, been disobeyed
in some countries. The Arab loves money, it is true;
but for all that we may rest assured that for the most
part the animals sold to us are of an inferior order, and
that the horses or mares whose noble and precious qualities
have been ascertained by proof, whether as regards
speed or as breeders, are never parted with to foreigners
for any price. Even if the owner were willing to let them
go, the whole tribe in the name of their common interest
would oppose it. This is the real truth, and probably
explains the disrepute into which Arabians appear to
have fallen in Europe. One seldom there meets with any
except such as the Arabs have no desire to keep. But
enough on that head: let us now turn to another topic.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Emir Abd-el-Kader asserts that the horse was
created <i>koummite</i>, red mixed with black, that is to
say, dark bay or dark chesnut. Desengaged from the
cloudiness of fancy, this assertion will at least go far to
prove that these colours have in all ages been esteemed
by the Arabs as the index to superior qualities. It is a
fixed idea with this observing people. It is constantly
turning up. The Prophet said:</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='Page_20'></a>"If after having collected all the horses of the Arabs
I were to make them race against one another, it is
the <i>euchegueur meglouk</i>, the dark chesnut, that would
outstrip the rest." Moussa, the celebrated conqueror of
Africa and Spain, is reported to have said: "Of all the
horses of all my armies the one that has best borne the
fatigues and privations of war is the true bay, <i>hameur
somm</i>."</p>

<p class='c009'>And the Prophet further remarked: "If thou hast a
dark chesnut, conduct him to the combat, and if thou
hast only a sorry chesnut, conduct him all the same to
the combat."</p>

<p class='c009'>From all this it is abundantly apparent that legendary
traditions and experience are in perfect harmony in according
a decided superiority to coats of deep and decided
hues. Coats of a light pale colour are held in no esteem
whatever. The horse's coat, therefore, must be an index
to his character. The long experience of Mohammed
the Prophet and of Moussa the Conqueror must have
placed them in a position to speak with full knowledge
of the subject, and their opinion confirmed by that of all
the Arabs, the best horsemen in the world and the most
interested in studying the animal, upon whom indeed
depend their honour and their life, is certainly entitled
to be regarded with some respect. It is beyond all question
that the <i>koummite</i>—red mingled with black, chesnut
or bay—is preferred by the Arabs to all others. If I might
be allowed to quote my own personal experience, I should
have no hesitation in saying that, if there be any prejudice
in the matter, I share it with them. Besides, must
it necessarily be a prejudice because it may seem to be
one? No one will deny that all the individuals of the
<a id='Page_21'></a>same species are, in their wild state, identical in colour
and endowed with common instinctive qualities inherent
in the race. These colours and these qualities undergo
no alteration or admixture except in a state of servitude
and under its influences, so that if any of these individuals,
by a return to their natural condition more easily
proved than explained, happen to recover the colour of
their first ancestors, they will be equally distinguished
by more broadly defined natural qualities. The canine
race may be taken as an illustration. Whence it follows
that a certain number of domesticated individuals being
given, their coats alike and with dominant qualities, it
may be fairly concluded that this coat and these qualities
were those of the race in its wild state. In the case,
then, of the Arab horse, if it be true that those whose
coat is red shaded with black are endowed with superior
speed, are we not justified in inferring that such was the
uniform colour, such the natural qualities, of the sires of
the race? I submit with all humility these observations
to men of science.</p>

<p class='c009'>Abd-el-Kader assures us, moreover, that it is ascertained
by the Arabs that horses change colour according
to the soil on which they are bred. Is it not possible, in
fact, that under the influence of an atmosphere more or
less light, of water more or less fresh, of a nurture more
or less rich according as the soil on which it is raised is
more or less impregnated with certain elements, the skin
of the horse may be sensibly affected? Every one knows
that with any coat, the colour changes in tone and shade
according to the locality where the animal lives, the
state of its health, the quality of the water it drinks,
and of the food it eats, and the care that is bestowed
<a id='Page_22'></a>upon it. There is perchance in all this a lesson in natural
history not to be despised, for if the circumstances in
which a horse lives act upon his skin, they must inevitably
act also in the long run upon his form and qualities.</p>

<p class='c009'>This point being dismissed, the last proposition in the
letter of the Emir Abd-el-Kader is that which classes the
history of Arab horses in four epochs: 1st, from Adam
to Ishmael; 2nd, from Ishmael to Solomon; 3rd, from
Solomon to Mohammed; 4th, from Mohammed to our
own times.</p>

<p class='c009'>This is the history of the Arabs themselves, so completely
have they identified themselves with the horse,
their necessary and indispensable companion. Between
Adam and Abraham the Arabs did not exist—it was the
age of a pastoral population. No wars, at least of a
serious character, no pillaging. The horse appears in it
only on the day of creation. He has no part to play
except as a head of cattle among the flocks and herds,
peacefully employed in domestic service. But on the
second epoch with Ishmael, his part changes altogether.
Ishmael is a bastard, disinherited, abandoned in the
desert. His life is to be a struggle. He must be at open
war with all mankind because he must live somehow upon
the soil to which he has been banished, without taking
into consideration the fact that this necessity of fighting
in order to live, at the same time gratifies the resentment
he entertains towards his brothers, heirs, to his prejudice,
of the paternal fields. We read in the Bible, that when
Hagar, in Arabic <i>Hadjira</i>, fled into the wilderness an
angel appeared to her and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>"I will multiply thy seed exceedingly that it shall not
be numbered for multitude.</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='Page_23'></a>"Behold, thou art with child, and shalt bear a son,
and shalt call his name Ishmael; and he will be a wild
man; his hand will be against every man, and every
man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence
of all his brethren."</p>

<p class='c009'>Ishmael is the personification of the Arab people. He
calls the horses to him, selects the best, and trains them
for racing, for the chase, and for war. It is by their
aid that he will live upon the plunder of the rich caravans
that may venture upon his territory, and will
make forays from the land of hunger and thirst into
the land of abundance. The horse has made him King
of the desert, and in return he makes a friend, a companion
of his horse. Between them there is only one
interest.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nevertheless, the Arabs, hard pressed to the eastward
by the powerful armies of the Kings of Abyssinia, to the
northward by the people of Jehovah,—one-half of them
absorbed and decimated in these great struggles; and the
other half shut in within their arid peninsula and divided
by intestine dissensions—the Arabs degenerated, and
with them their horses suffered deterioration. It was at
Jerusalem the Noble, and according to the legend in
the stud of Solomon, that the true type of the race was
exclusively preserved. Travellers, perhaps conductors
of the caravans which in those days used to arrive in
Jerusalem in great numbers, receive as a gift certain
horses, of whose value and fine qualities they are ignorant.
But under the influence of peace commerce again
discovers the long disused road from Central Asia to the
seaports of Syria, and the Arabs interested in making
common cause with one another reform themselves by
<a id='Page_24'></a>mutual alliances between tribes. The horse, on his part,
follows this new phase of their fortunes.</p>

<p class='c009'>At a later period, a fresh degeneracy arises in consequence
of the immigration into Arabia of foreigners,
Jews and Christians, and from quarrels among the Arabs
themselves. Some few noble and powerful tribes, such
as the Koreishites, for example, the most powerful and
the most noble of all, had preserved a traditional love of
the horse as inseparable from their original dignity.
But in order that Mohammed's task should have any
chance of accomplishment, it was necessary to extend
to all and to popularise this exceptional passion of a few,
and equally essential was it to condense into one national
unity the disunited elements of which the tribes of Arabia
then consisted. We have seen with what persistance
the Prophet reverts to this necessity, in the Koran, in
his conversations, and in his teachings, and how he
made the careful tendance of horses an obligation of
Mussulman life, and an article of faith in the Believer.
In this manner, from the Hidjra to our own times, the
condition of the Arab horses has unavoidably gone on
improving. Has he not said: "Whoso feeds and tends
a horse for the triumph of religion, makes a magnificent
loan to Allah"?</p>

<p class='c009'>I have only one more word to say on the portrait of
the thoroughbred horse sketched by Abd-el-Kader. The
Emir takes it at one view, and as inseparable one from
the other, both the physical and moral qualities. In his
opinion physical qualities alone will never constitute a
perfect horse. He must also by his intelligence and by
his affection for the master who feeds, who tends, who
rides him, unite with him as an integral part. To demand
<a id='Page_25'></a>such qualities from a horse is simply placing him,
in the intellectual order, immediately after man, just as,
according to the legend, he has been placed in the order
of creation.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Europeans are, I am aware, far from entertaining
such a high opinion of the animal, but may we not err
in the opposite degree?</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <a id='Page_26'></a>
  <h2 class='c004'>THE BARB.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>We have often heard it said that the horse of our
African possessions, to whose rare qualities we have
endeavoured to do justice, was very inferior to the true
Arabian. Notwithstanding a conviction based on a
lengthened experience and a grave study of the subject,
we have made it our duty to take up and discuss an opinion
put forth with an air of authority. We were willing
to accept as umpire in this dispute, a man whose intelligence,
whose habits, whose whole life, render him a
supreme judge in all matters relating to horse-flesh—the
Emir Abd-el-Kader. We addressed to that genuine
horseman a letter in which we frankly expressed the
objections which each of our assertions had encountered.
His reply to this letter is given below. It will be seen
from this curious document that the Emir does not confine
himself to the confirmation of the proposition we
advanced, but develops by reflections or by facts the
whole of our opinions. According to his statement, the
Barbary horse, so far from degenerating from the Arab,
is, on the contrary, superior to him. The Berbers, he
says, formerly inhabited Palestine, where they reared
<a id='Page_27'></a>the animal that has become the type of a perfect war horse.
Having emigrated to Africa through the vicissitudes
of their life of adventure, they paid the utmost
attention to the guest of their tents, the instrument of
their hunting expeditions, their comrade in the fight.
Their horses thus preserved such eminent qualities, that
an Asiatic sovereign engaged in a perilous war, sent for
them from the Berbers. The reader will appreciate the
value of this historical dissertation which, from whatever
point of view it be examined, does not the less possess an
interest that cannot be contested. It is quite certain that
the Barbary horse is indebted to the climate in which he
flourishes, to the education which he receives, to the
food that is given to him, to the privations that are familiar
to him, for a vigour that enables him to equal, if
not to surpass the most vaunted steeds of Persia and
Upper Egypt. Supported by the following letter, we
hold ourselves justified in repeating that all the horses
of Asia and Africa may be blended together under one
common denomination. We oppose to the European
horse, one identical horse—the horse of the Orient—which,
thanks to our conquest of Algeria, we believe will
be daily called upon to render to our country services
more and more valuable and more and more valued.</p>

<p class='c009'>This is the letter from the Emir Abd-el-Kader, which
he forwarded to me from Broussa:</p>

<p class='c010'>Praise to the one God! His reign alone is eternal!</p>

<p class='c010'>May the profoundest peace and the most perfect divine beneficence
be extended to the person of General Daumas,—of him who
ardently seeks for the solution of the most obscure questions!
May Allah conduct and protect him!</p>

<p class='c010'>To proceed: You have asked us our opinion on Barbary horses,
their character, and their origin. To give you satisfaction I am
<a id='Page_28'></a>again turning my attention to these subjects, and can do nothing
better to-day than send you some extracts taken from the poetical
works of the famous Aâmrou-el-Kaïs, who lived a short time
before the coming of the Prophet. They refer to the superiority
of the horses of the Berbers, and I think you will there find proofs
against those who maintain that those admirable animals are of
an inferior stamp. The poet remarks, while addressing himself to
Cæsar, Emperor of Constantinople, in a long piece of versification:</p>

<p class='c010'>"And I answer thee, if ever I am reinstated as King, we will
ride a race where you shall see the horseman lean forward over
his saddle to increase the speed of his courser;</p>

<p class='c010'>"A race across a space trampled down on all sides, where no
higher marks are distinguishable to direct the traveller, than
the hump of an aged Nabathæan camel loaded with years and
uttering plaintive moanings.</p>

<p class='c010'>"We shall be borne, I tell thee, on a horse accustomed to
nocturnal journeys, a steed of the Barbary race; with slender
flanks like a wolf of Gada; a steed that rushes along on his rapid
course, and whose flanks are running with sweat.</p>

<p class='c010'>"When, slackening the bridle, the rider urges him on still
faster by striking him with the reins on either side, he quickens
his rapid course, bending his head to his flanks and champing
the bit.</p>

<p class='c010'>"And when I say: 'Let us rest;' the horseman stops as by
enchantment and begins to sing, remaining in the saddle on this
vigorous horse, the muscles of whose thighs are long drawn out
and whose tendons are lean and well apart."</p>

<p class='c010'>Aâmrou-el-Kaïs was one of the ancient Kings of Arabia, who
took infinite pains to procure Barbary horses wherewith to combat
his enemies. He was doubtful of success if obliged to trust
himself to the qualities of Arab horses. It is not possible, in my
opinion, to give a more invincible proof of the superiority of the
Barb. After testimony like this any one who should dispute it
would be quite unable to adduce an allegation of the slightest
value.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Berbers, as stated by El-Massoudi, are descended from the
Beni-Ghassan, while other writers affirm that they come from
the Beni-Lekhm and the Djouzam. Their native country was
Palestine, whence they were expelled by one of the Kings of
Persia. They then emigrated to Egypt, but the souvereign of
that country refusing them permission to settle here, they
<a id='Page_29'></a>crossed the Nile and spread over the regions to the westward of
the other side of the river.</p>

<p class='c010'>Maleck-ben-el-Merahel says that the Berbers form a very
numerous population composed of Hymiar, Modher, Copts, Amalkas,
and Kanéan, who became amalgamated in the province of
Sham (Syria) and took the name of Berbers. Their immigration
into the Maghreb, according to this historian with whom El-Massoudi,
El-Souheili, and El-Zabari also agree, was owing to their
marching under Ifrikesh to the conquest of the African peninsula.</p>

<p class='c010'>Ibn-el-Kelbi asserts that opinions are divided as to the real
name of the chief under whose guidance the Berbers emigrated
from Syria towards the Maghreb. Some will have it that it was
under the Prophet David, others name Youssha-ben-Enoun,
others again Ifrikesh, and yet others certain Kings of the Zobor.</p>

<p class='c010'>El-Massoudi adds that they did not emigrate until after the
death of Goliath and that they established themselves in the
province of Barka and in the Maghreb, after having vanquished
the Frendj (Franks). They then invaded Sicily, Sardinia, the
Balearic Isles, and Spain. Still later it was stipulated between
them and the Frendj that the latter should occupy the towns,
while the former should fix themselves in the deserts which
extend from Alexandria to the Ocean.</p>

<p class='c010'>Ibn-Abd-el-Berr affirms that the establishment of the Berbers
extended from the extremity of Egypt, that is, from the regions
situated behind Barka to the Green Sea, and from the sea of
Andalusia to the end of the deserts which border on Soudan.
On this frontier line a tribe bearing the name of Berbers still
exists between the Habeuch (Abyssinians) and the Zendy (Zanzibar).
The author of the <i>Kamous</i> (an Arabic Dictionary) makes
mention of them, but they are a very insignificant tribe, whose
trivial and obscure history records not a single important event.</p>

<p class='c010'>The essential point here is the extract from the poet Aâmrou-el-Kaïs
on the subject of Barbary horses. As for the Berbers
themselves, every thing proves that they have been known from
time immemorial and that they came from the East to settle in
the Maghreb, where we find them at the present day.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <a id='Page_33'></a>
  <h2 class='c004'>THE HORSES OF THE SAHARA.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c015'>To a pastoral and a nomadic people, roaming our vast
grazing grounds, and whose numbers bear no proportion
to the extent of their territories, the horse is a necessity
of life. With his horse, the Arab trades and travels,
looks after his numerous flocks, distinguishes himself in
battle, at weddings, and at the festivals of his marabouts.
He makes love, he makes war: space is nothing to him.
Thus, the Arabs of the Sahara still give themselves up
with ardour to the rearing of horses. They know full
well the value of blood, they pay great attention to crossing
the breed, and try every means to improve the
species. The state of anarchy in which they have lived
in these latter times has naturally modified some of their
habits, but it has effected no change in this condition of
their existence—the breeding, perfecting and training
of horses.</p>

<p class='c010'>The love of the horse has passed into the Arab blood.
That noble animal is the friend and comrade of the chief
of the tent. He is one of the servants of the family.
His habits, his requirements are made an object of study.
He is the burden of their songs, the favourite topic of
conversation. Day by day in the gatherings outside the
<a id='Page_34'></a><i>douar</i>, where age alone enjoys the privilege of speech,
and which are marked by the decorous behaviour of the
listeners, seated in a circle on the sand or on the turf,
the young men add to their practical knowledge the
counsels and traditions of their seniors. Religion, war,
the chase, love, and horses, inexhaustible subjects of
observation, make regular schools of these open air meetings,
in which warriors are formed and develop their
intelligence in collecting a mass of facts, precepts, proverbs,
and sententious sayings, the application of which
will only too frequently occur in the course of the perilous
life they have to lead. It is thus they acquire that
knowledge of horse-flesh which we are so astonished to
meet with in the humblest horseman of a desert tribe.
He can neither read nor write, and yet every phrase in
his conversation rests upon the authority of the learned
commentators of the Koran, or of the Prophet himself.
"Our lord Mohammed declared"—"Sidi-Ahmed-ben-Youssef
says in addition"—"Si-ben-Dyab relates"—And
you may take him on trust, this learned ignoramus, for
all these texts, all these anecdotes, which for the most
part are only to be found in books, he for his part derives
from the <i>tholbas</i> or from his chiefs, who, unconsciously
come, as it were, to a mutual understanding, to develop
or maintain among the people the love of the horse, useful
precepts, sound doctrines, and the best rules of
hygiene. The whole is sometimes tainted, no doubt,
with gross prejudices and ridiculous superstitions. It is
a picture with much shading. But let us not be too
severe: it is not so very long since very nearly the same
absurdities were proclaimed in France as indisputable
truths.</p>

<p class='c010'><a id='Page_35'></a>I was talking one day with a marabout of the tribe of
the Oulad-Sidi-Schik about the horses of his country,
and pretended to question some of the opinions he had
expressed. "You cannot understand that, you Christians,"
he exclaimed, abruptly rising to his feet, "but
horses are our riches, our joys, our life, our religion.
Has not the Prophet said: 'The good things of this life,
even to the day of the last judgment, shall be suspended
from the hairs which are between the eyes of your
horses?'"</p>

<p class='c010'>"I have read the Koran," I replied, "but have never
met with those words."</p>

<p class='c010'>"You will not find them in the Koran, which is the
voice of Allah, but in the conversations of our lord
Mohammed (<i>Hadite sidna Mohammed</i>)."</p>

<p class='c010'>"And you believe in them?" I retorted.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Before taking my leave of you, I will show you what
may happen to those who have faith." And my companion
gravely recited the following history:</p>

<p class='c010'>"A poor man confiding in the words of the Prophet
which I have just repeated to you, came one day upon
a dead mare. So he cut off her head and buried it under
the threshold of his door, saying to himself: 'I shall
become rich if it please Allah' (<i>An-sha-Allah</i>). Days,
however, followed each other, but no riches came, and
yet the Believer never doubted. The Sultan of the
country being on his way to visit a holy spot, happened
by accident to pass before the lowly abode of the poor
Arab. It was situated at the end of a small plain
bordered by large trees and watered by a pretty rivulet.
The scene pleasing him, he halted his brilliant escort,
and dismounted to rest himself in the shade. Just as he
<a id='Page_36'></a>was about to give the signal to continue the journey his
steed, which a slave was employed to look after, impatient
to devour space, began to neigh and to paw the
ground, and presently broke loose. All the efforts of the
<i>saïs</i> (grooms) to catch him again were for a long time in
vain and every one was in despair, when they beheld
him stop suddenly of himself at the threshold of an old
hut which he smelt at while throwing up the ground
with his forefeet. An Arab, until that moment an unmoved
spectator, went up to him without frightening him,
as if he had been known to him, caressed him with hand
and voice, laid hold of him by the mane, the bridle
being in a thousand pieces, and without any difficulty
led him quietly up to the astonished Sultan.</p>

<p class='c010'>"How have you contrived," demanded his greatness,
"thus to tame one of the most fiery steeds of Arabia?"</p>

<p class='c010'>"You will no longer be surprised, my lord," replied
the man of faith, "when you learn that, having been
taught that all the good things of this world unto the
day of judgment shall be suspended from the hairs
which are between the eyes of our horses, I buried under
the door-way of my house the head of a mare I found
lying dead. The rest has come to pass through the
blessing of Allah."</p>

<p class='c010'>"The Sultan instantly caused the ground to be dug up
at the spot indicated, and when he had thus verified the
statement of the Arab, he hastened to recompense one
who had not hesitated to give an entire faith to the words
of the Prophet. The poor man received the present of a
fine horse, superb garments, and riches enough to place
him beyond the reach of want for the rest of his days."</p>

<p class='c010'>"You now know," continued the marabout, "what may
<a id='Page_37'></a>happen to those who believe," and without waiting for
my reply he saluted me with the eyes after the manner
of the Arabs, and withdrew.</p>

<p class='c010'>This legend is popular in the Sahara, and the words
of the Prophet on which it is founded are there an article
of faith. Whether the Prophet uttered them or not, they
do not the less surely answer the end proposed to himself
by their imputed author. The Arab loves honours,
power, riches. To tell him that all that was attached to
the long hairs of his horse was to endear it to him, to
bind it to him by the bond of a common interest. The
genius of the Prophet doubtless went much farther. He
fully understood that the mission of conquest which he
had bequeathed to his people could only be accomplished
by hardy horsemen, and that the love of the horse
must be developed in them simultaneously with faith in
Islam. These injunctions, which all tend towards the
same end, are clothed in various forms. The marabout
and the thaleb strung them together as sayings and
legends, the noble (<i>djieud</i>) as traditions, and the common
people as proverbs. Subsequently, proverbs, traditions,
and legends, assumed a religious character which has
for ever accredited them to the great family of Mussulmans:
for it is the will of the Prophet that his own
people, to the exclusion of all infidels, should reserve to
themselves these powerful instruments of war, which in
the hands of the Christians might become so fatal to the
Mussulman religion. This inner motive, which the common
people of the tent may not have seen, through the
symbolical veil behind which it was concealed, has not
escaped the perception of the Arab chiefs. The Emir
Abd-el-Kader, when at the height of his power, inflicted
<a id='Page_38'></a>death without mercy on every Believer convicted of
having sold a horse to a Christian. In Morocco the
exportation of these animals is hampered with such
heavy duties that the permission to take them out of
the kingdom is altogether illusory. At Tunis the same
reluctance yields only to the imperious necessities of
policy, and in like manner at Tripoli, in Egypt, at Constantinople,
in short in all Mussulman States.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c011'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>If you speak of horses to a <i>djieud</i>, the noble of the
tent, who still plumes himself on his ancestors having
fought with ours in Palestine, he will tell you:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c017'>
    <div>The mounting of horses,</div>
    <div>The letting slip greyhounds from the leash,</div>
    <div>And the clinking of ear-rings,</div>
    <div>Draw the maggots out of your head.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>If your interlocutor is one of those horsemen (<i>mekhazeni</i>)
whose bronzed face, pepper-and-salt beard, and
prominent exostosis<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c011'><sup>[5]</sup></a> on the tibia announce that he has
gone through many adventures, he will say to you:</p>

      <div class='line'>And oxen for poverty.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Or he will remind you that when the Prophet was
engaged in expeditions, in order to induce the Arabs to
tend their horses properly, he always gave two-thirds of
the prize to whomsoever had accompanied him on the
best horse.</p>

<p class='c010'><a id='Page_39'></a>The voluptuous Thaleb, man of God for the world
who lives in contemplative idleness, without any other
occupation than that of writing talismans and making
amulets for all men and women who want them, will
repeat to you with his eyes on the ground:</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus it is seen that among the Arabs every thing

and the distances to be traversed in a country</p>

make it a necessity. An Arab can only live a double

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c021'>
    <div>REMARKS BY THE EMIR ABD-EL-KADER.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The best horses are chiefly to be found in the Sahara,
where the number of bad horses is very small. In
fact, the tribes that inhabit it and those who border on
it only employ their horses to make war, or to contend
in trials of swiftness. Accordingly, they never use them
for agricultural purposes, or exercise them in any other
way than in battle. On this account their horses are
nearly all excellent.</p>

<p class='c010'>No individual in the Sahara cares to possess ten camels
until he has a horse to defend them against those
who might assail them.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the Tell most of the Arabs apply their horses to the
cultivation of the land. They also make use of them to
ride and for any other purpose. They have no particular
preference for males because in their eyes the horse is
merely an animal to be turned to any employment of
which it is capable, and not kept for war alone. For
this reason the horse of pure origin bred in the Sahara
is preferable to the same horse in the Tell. The former,
unlike that of the Tell, is subjected to fatigue, to long
journeys, to hunger, and to thirst, which renders him
able to achieve whatever is required of him.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Koran calls horses "the especial good."</p>

<p class='c010'>The servant of the Prophet used to say: "With
women, what the Prophet loved best was horses."</p>

<p class='c010'><a id='Page_45'></a>"Aïssa-ben-Meryem (Jesus, the son of Mary),—peace
be with him!—went one day to Eblis, the black demon,
and said: 'Eblis, I have a question to address to thee:
wilt thou tell me the truth?' 'Spirit of God,' answered
Eblis, 'question me as seemeth good to thee.'"</p>

<p class='c010'>"I demand of thee," pursued Jesus, "by the Living One
who cannot lie, what is it that can reduce thy body to a
liquid state and cut thy back in two?" "It is," replied
the devil, "the neighing of a horse. Never have I succeeded
in entering a house that contained a horse for
the cause of the Most High."</p>

<p class='c010'>Being passionately fond of horses, one of the companions
of the Prophet asked him if there were any in Paradise.
"If Allah causes thee to enter Paradise," replied the Prophet,
"thou wilt have a horse of rubies, furnished with two wings,
with which he will fly whithersoever thou willest."</p>

<p class='c010'>A poet has said: "Who are they who will weep for
me after death? My sword, my Boudaïna lance, and my
long-bodied chesnut, trailing the reins to the fountain,
after death has deprived him of his rider."</p>

<p class='c010'>In all times, among the Arabs, the horse has been the
object of the greatest solicitude, and this solicitude the
Prophet lost no opportunity of keeping up, developing
and augmenting by introducing the religious sentiment.</p>

<p class='c010'>We find in the collection of his conversations the
following precepts:</p>

<p class='c010'>"Happiness in this world, a rich booty, and eternal
rewards are attached to the forelock of horses."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Evil spirits enter not into a tent where there is a
thoroughbred horse."</p>

<p class='c010'>"The Angels sympathise with only the three following
<a id='Page_46'></a>pastimes of men: the exercises of war—the joys of
connubial love—and the running of horses."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Whensoever any one is prevented from fulfilling his
religious duties, let him keep a horse for the sake of
Allah, and all his sins shall be forgiven him."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Whoso maintaineth a horse for the triumph of religion
makes a magnificent loan to Allah."</p>

<p class='c010'>"The horse, sincerely reared in the way of Allah, for
the holy war, shall save his master from the fire at the
day of the resurrection."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Whoso maketh sacrifices in order to train a horse for
the holy war shall be treated in the next world as a
martyr."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Whoso traineth a horse in the way of Allah is counted
in the number of those who give alms day and night, in
secret or in public. He shall have his reward. Never
shall fear dishonour his heart."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Money spent upon horses passes in the eyes of Allah
for alms given in a direct manner."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Whoso keepeth and tendeth a horse for the service of
Allah shall be recompensed as one who fasts during the
day and passes the night in prayer."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Horses pray to Allah to make them beloved by their
masters."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Allah comes to the aid of such as occupy themselves
with horses, and lightens the expenses incurred on their
account."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Every grain of barley given to a horse is inscribed
by Allah in the Register of good Works."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Martyrs of the holy war will find in Paradise horses
of rubies, furnished with wings, which shall fly
whithersoever their riders desire."</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <a id='Page_47'></a>
  <h2 class='c004'>BREEDS.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c015'>The tribes that inhabit the Sahara have always been
better able than those of the Tell to withdraw from the
caprice, oppression, and spoliation of the various conquerors
of Africa. It is therefore evidently among them
that the Barb has had the best chance of preserving all
the qualities of grace, speed, and sobriety, that are
universally regarded as its characteristics. We shall
consequently confine ourselves exclusively to the horses
of that region, and with a view to avoid a repetition of
what every one has read in books, we shall allow the
many Arabs we have interrogated, to speak for themselves.
Here, then, is the outline they have drawn
of the thoroughbred horse, <i>shareb-er-rehh</i>, "the air-drinker:"</p>

<p class='c010'>The thoroughbred horse is well proportioned, his ears
are small and in constant motion, his bones massive, his
cheeks meagre, his nostrils wide as the throat of a lion,
his eyes bright, black, and level with the head,<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c011'><sup>[20]</sup></a> his
neck long, his chest full, his withers prominent, his
<a id='Page_48'></a>loins well knit, his haunches strong, his fore-ribs long
and the hinder ones short, the belly hollow, the croup
rounded, the upper part of his legs long like an ostrich's
and furnished with muscles like a camel's, his hoofs
black and of a uniform colour, his hair fine and abundant,
his flesh firm, his tail very thick at the dock but
loose at the extremity. Looked at in front he is like
unto the peak of a lofty mountain. Looked at from behind,
he seems to lean forward as if he would prostrate
himself. Looked at from the side, he shows himself
robust and well set up.</p>

<p class='c010'>To sum up: he should have four points broad, the
front, the chest, the croup, and the legs;—four points
long, the neck, the upper part of the legs, the belly,
and the haunches;—four points short, the loins, the
pasterns, the ears, and the tail. All these qualities in a
good horse, say the Arabs, prove firstly that he has real
blood in him, and secondly that he is certainly fleet of
foot, for his form combines something of the greyhound,
the pigeon, and the <i>mahari</i>, or riding camel.<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c011'><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The mare ought to take from the wild boar its courage
and breadth of head; from the gazelle, its grace, its
eyes and mouth; from the antelope, liveliness and intelligence;
from the ostrich, its neck and swiftness; from
the viper, the shortness of its tail.</p>

<p class='c010'><a id='Page_49'></a>A thoroughbred horse (<i>hôor</i>)<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c011'><sup>[22]</sup></a> may be known by yet
other signs. For instance, he cannot be prevailed upon
to eat barley out of any other nosebag than his own.
He so loves trees, verdure, shade, and running water,
that he will neigh for joy on seeing them. Seldom does
he drink until he has troubled the water, and if the conformation
of the ground prevents him from doing so with
his feet, he will kneel down and do it with his mouth.
He is continually shrivelling his lips; his eyes are in
constant motion; alternately he pricks up and lowers his
ears, and turns his neck to the right or left as if he
wished to speak, or to ask for something. If to all these
signs a horse adds sobriety of disposition, his owner
may deem himself the possessor of a pair of wings.</p>

<p class='c010'>It has been remarked that a horse that is a fast galopper
has the head firmly set on, and the transverse apophysis
of the atloïd very protuberant. "He has horns," say the
Arabs.</p>

<p class='c010'>The races most esteemed in the western part of the
Algerian Sahara are three in number: that of Hâymour,
that of Bou-Ghareb, and that of Merizigue. Their offspring
are dispersed among a great many tribes, such
as the Hamyân, the Oulad-Sidi-Shikh, the Leghrouât-Kuesal,
the Oulad-Yagoub, the Makena, the Aâmour, the
Oulad-Sidi-Nasseur, and even the Harar. Every one, according
to his fancy, or according to his occupation,
offers his mare to the descendants of one of these three
types. The Hâymour usually produce bay horses, the
Bou-Ghareb white ones, and the Merizigue those of a
gray colour. The Hâymour are most sought after. They
<a id='Page_50'></a>are of a beautiful shape, with a good carcass, and yet
very active. They pass for the swiftest coursers of the
Sahara, and preserve their strength to a very advanced
age. They bring good luck, and their owners belong
to the richest and noblest families.</p>

<p class='c010'>Next come the race of Bou-Ghareb, the produce of
which are taller, and are also very patient of fatigue,
but less fleet than the Hâymour. Like the latter, however,
they remain sound until a great age.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lastly the Merizigue who are shorter and have less
bottom than the preceding, but are solid, clean-limbed,
and sober. They are chiefly sought after by common
horsemen who have long journeys to make and great
hardships to undergo.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Hâymour breed is superior to all others; nor has the
imagination of the Arabs failed to trace it to a marvellous
source. The legend runs as follows:—A chief owned
a magnificent mare, which happened to receive a serious
hurt in hunting the ostrich. It was feared that she
would be lame for life. Her master though he could
see no improvement in her condition and was annoyed
at the trouble of dragging her after him in all his
removals from place to place, was still unable to bring
himself to put her to death, and therefore turned her out
to graze at large. On returning from a long journey he
remembered his mare and inquired what had become of
her. She proved to be in excellent health, and on the
point of foaling. He at once brought her in, took the
greatest care of her, and soon afterwards found himself
possessed of a foal that was unrivalled throughout the
desert. As no tribe had passed for a very long time near
the place where he left the animal, the Arabs were
<a id='Page_51'></a>willing to believe that she had been covered by a wild
ass, <i>hamar el ouâhhch</i>, and they gave to the foal the
name of Hâymour, which is that of the foal of the onager.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the central part of the Algerian Sahara, the Arbâa<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c011'><sup>[23]</sup></a>
affect the offspring of <i>Rakeby</i>. This breed has both
height and bottom, and is found among the Aghrazelias,
the Oulad-Shayb, the Oulad-Mokhtar, and even among
the Oulad-Khrelif.<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c011'><sup>[24]</sup></a> For the most part they are gray or
dark bay. They endure hunger and thirst with ease,
and without being knocked up will cover for several
consecutive days distances of twenty-five to thirty
leagues.<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c011'><sup>[25]</sup></a> At the present day the finest animals are
in the family of the Seuffrân. <i>Rakeby</i>, it seems, was
formerly brought from Morocco by the ancestors of
Sidi-Hamed-Oulad-<i>Tedjini</i>, the famous Marabout of
Aain-Mady.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Oulad-Nayl<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c011'><sup>[26]</sup></a> make use of the offspring of a
celebrated stallion named El-Biod, "the White," formerly
the property of the Oulad-Si-Mahmed, one of their divisions.
This stock is renowned for its sobriety and speed.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the Hodna and the Medjana, among the Oulad-Makrane
and the Ghiras, the most highly esteemed are
the descendants of a well-known stallion belonging to
the Oulad-Mahdi. It was named Bey-el-Hissen, and was
the property of the family of El-Amri-ben-Abi-Meramer.</p>

<p class='c010'>A good horse in the desert ought to accomplish for
five or six days, one after the other, distances of twenty-
<a id='Page_52'></a>five to thirty leagues. After a couple of day's rest, if
well fed, he will be quite fresh enough to repeat the feat.
"With a horse that on arriving at a resting place
shakes himself, paws the ground with his foot, and
neighs at the approach of the barley, then pushing his
head into the nosebag begins to munch eagerly three or
four mouthfuls of the grain, there is no occasion to pull
up in a journey." The distances to be traversed in the
Sahara are not always of such great length, but at the
same time it is no very rare occurrence to hear of horses
doing fifty to sixty leagues in four and twenty hours.</p>

<p class='c010'>A tribe on receiving notice that its enemies project a
razzia, at once sends out scouts (<i>shouâfin</i>) to watch them,
mounted on mares, "the children of a Jew"—<i>benate el
ihoude</i>—so cunning and dexterous are they. These
horsemen take with them no more than a feed of barley
for their horse's supper. They frequently vary their pace
but are always careful to husband their steeds, and will
place themselves in ambush thirty leagues from their
point of departure in order to "kill the earth"—that is,
to reconnoitre. If the result of their observations causes
them to entertain any immediate apprehension for the
safety of their brethren, they return at once at full speed
to warn them to take to hasty flight. In the contrary
event, they retrace their steps leisurely and will yet
gain their tents before the hour of the evening prayer,
after having traversed sometimes fifty to sixty leagues
in the twenty-four hours. Should there be a skirmish
on the morrow, their horses will be in a condition to
take part in it. If the horse of a <i>shouaf</i> happens to die
in the course of a reconnaissance made for the good of
all, it is replaced at the expense of the whole tribe.</p>

<p class='c010'><a id='Page_53'></a>With regard to the great distances accomplished by
the horses of the desert, instances may be quoted which
will appear incredible, and the heroes of which are still
alive, if witnesses were wanted to confirm the truth of
the story. Here is one of a thousand, which was told to
me by a man of the tribe of Arbâa. I give his own words:</p>

<p class='c010'>"I had come into the Tell with my father and the
people of my tribe to buy corn. It was in the time of the
Pasha Ali. The Arbâa had had some terrible quarrels
with the Turks, and as it was their interest for the moment
to feign a complete submission in order to obtain
an amnesty for the past, they agreed to win over by
presents of money the Pasha's suite, and to send to
himself not merely a common animal as was customary,
but a courser of the highest distinction. It was a misfortune,
but it was the will of Allah, and we were forced
to resign ourselves. The choice fell upon a mare "gray
stone of the river," known throughout the Sahara, and the
property of my father. He was informed that he must hold
himself in readiness to set out with her on the morrow
for Algiers. After the evening prayer my father, who
had taken care not to make any remark, came to me and
said: 'Ben-Zyan, art thou thyself to-day? Wilt thou leave
thy father in a strait, or wilt thou make red his face?'"</p>

<p class='c010'>"I am nothing but your will, my lord," I replied.
"Speak, and if your commands are not obeyed, it will be
because I am vanquished by death."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Listen. These children of sin seek to take my mare
in the hope of settling their affairs with the Sultan,
my gray mare, I say, which has always brought good
fortune to my tent, to my children, and the camels: my
gray mare, that was foaled on the day that thy youngest
<a id='Page_54'></a>brother was born! Speak! Wilt thou let them do this
dishonour to my hoary beard? The joy and happiness of
the family are in thy hands. <i>Mordjana</i> (such was the
name of the mare) has eaten her barley. If thou art of a
truth my son, go and sup, take thy arms, and then at
earliest nightfall flee far away into the desert with the
treasure dear to us all."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Without answering a word I kissed my father's hand,
took my evening repast, and quitted Berouaguïa,<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c011'><sup>[27]</sup></a> happy
in being able to prove my filial affection, and laughing
in my sleeve at the disappointment which awaited our
sheikhs on their awaking. I pushed forward for a long
time, fearing to be pursued, but Mordjana continued to
pull at her bridle and I had more trouble to quiet her
than to urge her on. When two-thirds of the night had
passed, and a desire to sleep was growing upon me, I
dismounted and seizing the reins twisted them round my
wrist. I placed my gun under my head and at last fell
asleep, softly couched on one of those dwarf palms so
common in our country. An hour afterwards I roused
myself. All the leaves of the dwarf palm had been
stripped off by Mordjana. We started afresh. The peep
of day found us at Souagui. My mare had thrice broken
out into a sweat, and thrice dried herself. I touched her
with the heel. She watered at Sidi-Bou-Zid in the Ouad-Ettouyl,
and that evening I offered up the evening prayer
at Leghrouât, after giving her a handful of straw to
induce her to wait patiently for the enormous bag of
barley that was coming to her. These are not journeys
<a id='Page_55'></a>fit for your horses," said Si-ben-Zyan in conclusion,
"—for the horses of you Christians, who go from Algiers
to Blidah, thirteen leagues, as far as from my nose to my
ear, and then fancy you have done a good day's work."</p>

<p class='c010'>This Arab, for his part, had done eighty leagues in
twenty-four hours: his mare had eaten nothing but the
leaves of the dwarf palm on which he had lain down and
had only once been watered, about the middle of the
journey; and yet he swore to me by the head of the
Prophet that he could have slept on the following night
at Gardaya, forty five leagues farther on, had his life
been in any danger. Si-ben-Zyan belongs to a family of
marabouts of the Oulad-Salahh, a section of the great
tribe of the Arbâa. He comes frequently to Algiers and
will tell this story to whoever will listen to him, confirming
his narrative, if required, by authentic testimony.</p>

<p class='c010'>Another Arab, named Mohammed-ben-Mokhtar, had
come to buy corn in the Tell after the harvest. His
tents were already pitched on Ouad-Seghrouan, and he
had opened a business communication with the Arabs of
the Tell,<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c011'><sup>[28]</sup></a> when the bey Bou-Mezrag, "father of the
spear," fell upon him at the head of a strong body of
cavalry to chastise one of those imaginary offences which
the Turks were in the habit of inventing as pretexts for
their rapacity. Not the slightest warning had been
given; the razzia was complete; and the horsemen of
Makhzen gave themselves up to all the atrocities customary
in such cases. Mohammed-ben-Mokhtar thereupon
threw himself on his dark bay mare, a magnificent
<a id='Page_56'></a>animal known and coveted throughout the Sahara, and
perceiving the critical nature of the situation, at once
resolved to sacrifice the whole of his property to save
the lives of his three children. One of them, only four
years old, he placed on the saddle before him, and
another aged six or seven behind him holding on by the
troussequin, and was about to place the youngest in the
hood of his burnous when his wife stopped him, exclaiming:
"No, no, I will not let thee have this one. They
will never dare to slay an infant at its mother's breast.
Away, I shall keep him with me. Allah will protect
us." Mohammed-ben-Mokhtar then dashed forward, fired
off his piece, and got clear of the mêlée; but, being hotly
pursued, he travelled all that day and the following
night until he reached Leghrouât, where he could rely
upon being in safety. Shortly afterwards he received
intelligence that his wife had been rescued by some
friends he had in the Tell. Mohammed-ben-Mokhtar
and his wife are still alive, and the two children he
carried on his saddle are spoken of as two of the best
horsemen of the tribe. Can there be imagined a scene
more dramatic, or more worthy of a skilful artist, than
this family being saved by a horse from the midst of
plunder, confusion, and fighting!</p>

<p class='c010'>And why should I look for evidence to establish these
facts? All the old officers of the Oran division can state
how, in 1837, a General attaching the greatest importance
to the receipt of intelligence from Tlemcen, gave
his own charger to an Arab to go and procure the news.
The latter set out from Château Neuf<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c011'><sup>[29]</sup></a> at four o'clock in
<a id='Page_57'></a>the morning and returned at the same hour on the
following day, having travelled seventy leagues over
ground very different from the comparatively level
desert.</p>

<p class='c010'>One of the best and most formidable horsemen of this
tribe of the Arbâa is El-Arby-ben-Ouaregla; "his ball
never falls to the ground." He belongs to the section of
the Hadjadj, among whom he is celebrated both by
reason of his personal prowess and because of an adventure
that befell him in his infancy. He was still at the
breast, when his father, Mohammed-ben-Dokha, being
surprised by the enemy, rolled him in his large <i>habaya</i><a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c011'><sup>[30]</sup></a>
and fastened him in it with his girdle. Then, whilst his
family and his flocks sought safety in flight, he mounted
a mare that "could wring a tear from the eye," and
fighting all day in the rearguard saved his property and
killed seven of his assailants.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Arabs of the Sahara sum up the perfection of a
horse in the following manner. He must carry a full
grown man, his arms and a change of clothing, food for
both his rider and himself, a flag, even on a windy day,
and if necessary, dragging a dead body behind him,
keep up at a good pace the whole day through without
giving a thought to food or water. In their opinion a
horse lives from twenty to twenty-five years, and a mare
from twenty-five to thirty. As to the service to be derived
from this animal, a proverb exactly expresses their
idea:</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Sebâa el Khrouya</i>, seven years for my Brother;</div>
      <div class='line'><i>Sebâa lya</i>, seven years for myself;</div>
      <div class='line'><i>Sebâa li adouya</i>, seven years for my enemy.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><a id='Page_58'></a>It is therefore from seven to fourteen that they consider
a horse as most apt for the exercises of war. I have
often had the curiosity to inquire of the Arabs if they
know whence they had received the horses of which they
were so proud. In reply to this question they would
point with their finger to the East, and answer: "They
come from the native country of the first man, where
they were created a day or two before him." And as
confirmation of this their belief, they would add: "Allah
hath said: 'I have created for man whatsoever is upon
the earth. I give it all to Adam and his descendants.
Man shall be the most noble of created beings, and the
horse the most noble of animals.' Now, when a chief is
expected to come and rule over us we prepare a tent to
receive him, carpets for him to sit upon, and various
dishes to gratify his palate, and, above all, horsemen to
attend upon him and execute his orders. Consequently
the horse must have been created before the coming of
Adam upon the earth."</p>

<p class='c015'>THE STEED OF NOBLE RACE.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c017'>
    <div>Where are those noble steeds</div>
    <div>Whose dam never knew any but a noble sire?</div>
    <div>The stirrup is their life; inaction is death to them.</div>
    <div>O Father of cavaliers! the ignorant find them every where,</div>
    <div>But they are as rare as true friends,</div>
    <div>And when they die the very saddle sheds tears.</div>
    <div class='c001'>In the race-course of valour</div>
    <div>May Allah bless the noble courser!</div>
    <div>His chest is of steel, and his flanks of iron:</div>
    <div>He loves naught but rapine, glory, and the combat;</div>
    <div>He cherishes his master and his family,</div>
    <div>And when he gallops, he puts the thunder to shame.</div>
    <div>He passes, look at him: he is already out of sight;</div>
    <div>Women, grudge him not the milk of our she-camels.</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>REMARKS BY THE EMIR ABD-EL-KADER.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Horses, though they are all of one and the same family,
are of two different species: the first is the Arab
<a id='Page_60'></a>race, the other the race of the <i>Beradin</i>. In like manner
oxen, though of only one family, are of divers species:
the first that of domestic cattle, which is the best known,
and the second that of buffaloes: as different from one
another in agility and weight as are the Arab horses
from the <i>Beradin</i>. In like manner, too, the family of
camels is one, and yet includes more than one species,—the
Arab race and the race <i>Bakhati</i>.<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c011'><sup>[31]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>If the foal has for its sire an Arab horse, and for its
dam an Arab mare, it is indisputably noble, <i>hôor</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>If it has for its sire an Arab horse, and for its dam a
<i>Beradi</i> mare, it is called <i>Hadjin</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>If it has for its dam an Arab mare and for its sire a
<i>Beradi</i> horse, it is called <i>Meghrif</i>, and it is inferior to
the <i>Hadjin</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hence it will be seen that the most important rôle is
assigned to the sire.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is impossible, we think, to get a pure race out of a
stock the blood of which is impure. On the other hand
it is a well authenticated fact that it is quite possible to
restore to its primitive nobleness a breed that has become
impoverished,—but without any taint in its blood,—whether
through insufficient food, want of proper care,
or excessive and unsuitable work: in a word, a race may
be restored, the degeneracy of which has not been occasioned
by any admixture of blood.</p>

<p class='c009'>In default of public notoriety, it is by actual trial, by
speed combined with bottom, that the Arabs form their
judgment on horses, and recognise the nobleness and
purity of their extraction. But the form likewise reveals
<a id='Page_61'></a>the higher qualities. A thoroughbred horse is one that
has three things long, three things short, three things
broad, and three things clean. The three things long are
the ears, the neck, and the fore-legs. The three things
short are the dock, the hind-legs and the back. The
three things broad are the forehead, the chest, and the
croup. The three things clean are the skin, the eyes,
and the hoof.</p>

<p class='c009'>He ought to have the withers high, and the flanks
hollow and without any superfluous flesh.</p>

<p class='c009'>"Dost thou accomplish a journey at great speed with
steeds high in the withers and fine in the flanks?"</p>

<p class='c009'>The tail should be well furnished at the root, so that
it may cover the space between the thighs.</p>

<p class='c009'>"The tail is like unto the veil of a bride."</p>

<p class='c009'>The eye of a horse should be turned as if trying to
look at its nose, like the eye of a man who squints.</p>

<p class='c009'>"Like to a beautiful coquette who leers through her
veil, his glance towards the corner of the eye pierces
through the hair of the forelock which covers his forehead
as with a veil."</p>

<p class='c009'>The ears resemble those of an antelope startled in the
midst of her herd.</p>

<p class='c009'>The forelock, abundant.</p>

<p class='c009'>"In the hour of pain mount a slender mare whose
forehead is covered by silky and flowing hair."</p>

<p class='c009'>The nostrils, wide.</p>

<p class='c009'>"Each of his nostrils resembles the den of a lion; the
wind rushes out of it when he is panting."</p>

<p class='c009'>The cavities in the interior of the nostrils ought to be
entirely black. If they are partly black and partly white
the horse is of only moderate value.</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='Page_62'></a>The fetlock, thick.</p>

<p class='c009'>"They have fetlocks that resemble the down which is
concealed beneath an eagle's wing and like him they
grow black in the heat of battle."</p>

<p class='c009'>The fetlock joints, small.</p>

<p class='c009'>"The fetlock joints of their hind-legs are small, but
the muscles on both sides stand out prominent."</p>

<p class='c009'>The hoof, round and hard.</p>

<p class='c009'>"The hoof should resemble the cup of a slave. They
walk on hoofs hard as the moss-covered stones of a
stagnant pool."</p>

<p class='c009'>The frogs, hard and dry.</p>

<p class='c009'>"The frogs concealed beneath the hoofs are seen when
he lifts his feet, and resemble date-stones in hardness."</p>

<p class='c009'>"When my courser rushes towards a goal he makes a
noise like to that of wings in motion, and his neigh
resembles the mournful note of the nightingale."</p>

<p class='c009'>"His neck is long and graceful as a male ostrich's. His
ear is split in two and his black eye full of fire."</p>

<p class='c009'>"In the elegance of his form he resembles a picture
painted in a palace. He is as majestic as the palace
itself."</p>

<p class='c009'>If by protruding his head and neck in order to drink
from a stream that flows level with the ground, a horse
can remain upright on all fours without bending either
of his fore-legs, be assured that his form is perfect, that
all parts of his body harmonise with one another, and
that he is thoroughbred.</p>

<p class='c009'>Among the horses of the tribes of the Sahara, those of
the Hamyân, the Arbâa, the Oulad-Naïl, and their respective
branches, are the most patient of hunger and
thirst, the most capable of enduring fatigue, the fleetest
<a id='Page_63'></a>gallopers, and the most able to keep up a good pace for
several days together without stopping,—very different
in that respect from the horses of the Tell.</p>

<p class='c009'>There existed in ancient times several stallions whose
fame has come down to us. Among others, <i>el Koura</i>,
of the tribe of the Beni-Timin, and <i>Aouadj</i>, "the concave,"
of the tribe of the Beni-Helal. On the subject of
this latter, the following anecdote is told: His master
being asked, "what canst thou relate of a surprising
nature in connection with thy horse?" recounted this
anecdote:</p>

<p class='c009'>"I was wandering one day in the desert mounted on
<i>Aouadj</i>, when I was seized with a violent thirst. By
good fortune, I fell in with a flock of ketâa<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c011'><sup>[32]</sup></a> flying
towards a spring. I followed them, and though holding
in my horse as much as possible, I reached the water as
soon as they did, without once pulling up to breath him.
It is a most extraordinary example of speed, for the
flight of the <i>ketâa</i>, always rapid, is greatly quickened
when, driven by thirst, it makes for water.... Had I not,"
continued the owner of <i>Aouadj</i>, "checked his speed by
pulling at the bridle with all my force, I should have
outstripped the <i>ketâa</i>."</p>

<p class='c009'>The origin of this stallion's name is this: He had not
been long foaled, when his master was attacked by enemies
and forced to flee. The foal being too weak to
follow by itself, was put into a sack and placed upon the
back of a beast of burden. Thence were derived the
roundness of his back and his name <i>Aouadj</i>, which bears
that signification.</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='Page_64'></a>Another celebrated stallion—here the Emir relates
the origin of the race of the Hâymour (see page 50) and
adds: "Whoever has seen the horses of that breed will
not question for a moment the truth of the tale, for their
resemblance to the zebra strikes every eye."</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <a id='Page_65'></a>
  <h2 class='c004'>THE SIRE AND THE DAM.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>The Arabs affirm that the best age for reproduction is
from four to twelve years as regards the mare, and from
six to fourteen as regards the horse. Exacting as
concerns the mare, which must be of good descent, swift
of foot, of good height, of sound constitution, and of a
graceful form, they are still more difficult to please as
concerns the horse. "Choose him" say they, "and
choose him again, for the offspring always resembles
the sire rather than the dam." They do not object,
however, to the horse being of shorter stature than the
mare, provided he be of pure race and sound in wind
and limb. They attach far more importance to bottom,
speed, and sobriety than to that conventional type of
beauty which is so seductive in our eyes. Thus a
stallion, fat, sleek, rounded in all parts, and who owes
the brilliancy of his form to high feeding, indolence of
disposition, or inaction, excites their distrust in the
highest degree. They will say of such an animal: "Let
us not be in a hurry. Let us see him at work. There
may possibly be nothing there but a lion's hide upon
the back of a cow." But, on the other hand they
<a id='Page_66'></a>esteem as a genuine sire a horse for long journeys,
whose flesh is firm, whose ribs are bare, his limbs clean
and his respiration powerful. He must also be endowed
with a good temper, and have given proof of being able
to bear great fatigue, privations, and hardships.</p>

<p class='c009'>As to the mare, the case has been pending for centuries.
Now as formerly the custom is to picture an
Arab by the side of his mare. The gold of the purchaser
glitters at his feet, but whilst this gold is being counted
out the descendant of Ishmael casts a melancholy look
on the noble animal from whom he cannot bring himself
to separate. He springs upon her back and rushes
far away into the desert: "The eye knoweth not where he
has passed." Such is the orthodox representation; let us
now see the truth as depicted by the Emir Abd-el-Kader:</p>

<p class='c009'>The Arabs prefer mares to horses, it is true, but only
for the three following reasons. The first is because
they consider the profit to be derived from a mare as
something very handsome, for it is well-known that as
much as fifteen to twenty thousand <i>douros</i> (from £3,000
to £4,000) have been received for the offspring of a
single mare. Hence they may be often heard to exclaim:
"The head of riches is a mare that produces a mare."
And this idea gathers strength in their eyes from it
having been said by our lord Mohammed, the messenger
of Allah: "Give the preference to mares; their belly is a
treasure, and their back a seat of honour. The greatest
of blessings is an intelligent woman, or a prolific mare."
These words are thus explained by commentators:
"Their belly is a treasure," because a mare by means of
her offspring increases the wealth of her master; and
"their back is a seat of honour," because the pace of a
<a id='Page_67'></a>mare is more easy and agreeable; some even going so
far as to say that the easiness of her gait will after a
time render her rider effeminate.</p>

<p class='c009'>The second motive is that the mare does not neigh in
time of war like the horse, and is less sensitive as to
hunger, thirst, and heat, and is therefore of greater use
to a people whose riches consist principally in flocks of
camels and sheep. It is known to all, that camels and
sheep do not really thrive except in the Sahara, where
the ground is so arid that many Arabs, being unable to
procure water more than once in eight or ten days,
accustom themselves to drink nothing but milk. This is
one of the consequences of the great distance that
frequently, on account of the pasturage, divides the
encampment from a spot where there are wells. The
mare is like the serpent: her strength increases in the
hot season and in torrid regions. A snake that lives in
a cold country or in water has very little life or venom,
so that its bite is rarely mortal; whereas a snake that
lives in a hot country is full of life, and the virulence of
its poison is intensified. Contrary to the horse who is
less capable of supporting the heat of the sun, the mare,
owing doubtless to her temperament, finds her vigour
doubled in the hottest season.</p>

<p class='c009'>The third and last motive is, the little attention required
by the mare. She feeds on anything. Her owner
leads or sends her to graze on the same herbage as the
sheep and camels. There is no occasion to place a
watchman in regular attendance. The horse, however,
cannot dispense with being well kept, nor can his owner
send him to the pasture without a <i>saïs</i>, or groom, to look
after him.</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='Page_68'></a>Such are the true reasons for the preference which
Arabs show for mares. This preference is not caused by
an idea that the foal inherits from its dam more than
from its sire, or that it is better on all occasions to ride
a mare than a horse. But it rests partly on substantial
benefits received, and partly on the necessities of the life
which the Arabs habitually lead. It may be laid down,
then, as a fact that the horse is more noble than the
mare, and that the sire bequeaths to the foal more than
the mare does, which the Arabs express by the saying:
<i>El mohor itebaâ el Faâl</i>, "the foal follows the stallion."
I admit, however, that the best produce is that which
proceeds from a sire and a dam both of pure race. In
this case, it is gold allying itself with gold. I will add
that the horse is stronger, of a higher courage and
greater speed than the mare, and is free from the grave
drawback attendant on the latter of stopping short
under her rider, even in battle and at a time perhaps
when everything depends on rapid movement.</p>

<p class='c009'>There can be no doubt that the foal proceeds from the
stallion and the mare. But the experience of ages
demonstrates that the essential parts of the body, such
as the bones, tendons, nerves, and veins follow after the
sire. The mare may impart to her young the colour of
her coat, a general resemblance, and something of her
frame, but it is the stallion that transmits the strength
of the bones, the vigour of the nerves, the solidity of the
tendons, speed and all the other most important characteristics.
He also communicates to his offspring his
moral qualities, and if he is really noble, preserves him
from all vice, for the Arabs of old have said: "The noble
horse has no malice."</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c009'><a id='Page_69'></a>No sooner has the foal seen the light than one of the
bystanders takes it in his arms, and walks up and down
with it for some time in the midst of almost inconceivable
noise and uproar. It is supposed that a useful lesson
is thus taught for the future—the animal, accustomed
from its birth to horrible sounds, will never afterwards
be frightened at anything. This lesson finished, the
master of the tent places the right dug of the mare in
the foal's mouth, and exclaims: "In the name of Allah!
Allah grant that the new-born (<i>mezyoud</i>) may bring us
good fortune, health, and abundance!" The friends who
are present answer all together: "Amen! May Allah
bless thee! He has sent thee another child."<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c011'><sup>[33]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>To teach the foal to suck, a fig or a date soaked in
milk slightly salted is put into his mouth. As soon as he
has taken a liking to it and begins to suck it, he is
placed under his dam. After two or three attempts he
soon mistakes the dug for the fig or date he has just
left, and the thing is done. After that he is carefully
preserved from the night-cold. But it is also necessary
to accustom him to drink camel's and ewe's milk. It is
done in this manner. They take a goat's skin used
several years for holding milk, and fill it with air. Then
squeezing it gently, they blow up his nostrils a few
times. By way of complement to this operation they
crush dates in milk, which impart to it a sweetish flavour
<a id='Page_70'></a>and then place the mixture close to the foal's mouth,
forcing him every now and then to dip his lips into it.
He begins by tasting and licking it and after a while
drinks it, whether the dam gives him suck or not. Great
importance is attached to teaching the foal to drink
milk; first, because he can thus be left in the tent while
the mare is again put to work; and secondly, because in
after years, in default of water, he will be satisfied with
milk instead, and also as food if barley runs short.
Should the mare take an aversion to her young, she
must be separated from him, and the latter must be
brought up on camel's milk, as this is deemed preferable
to the milk of the cow or the she-goat, which produces
laziness and heaviness.</p>

<p class='c009'>A few days or a few months after the birth of a foal,
some Arabs slit one or both of the ears. This fancy is
accounted for in various ways. According to one party
this operation is performed on animals born in the night
time, because they ought to have a better sight than
those that come into the world during the day. According
to others, it is done to foals born on Friday, the
day of the gathering together of Mussulmans at the
mosque, because it is a lucky sign. The truth is simply
this: The master of a tent has a child of tender years,
whom he loves very dearly. In slitting the ear of his
foal he declares that he reserves him for his son so-and-so.
Should the father afterwards die, no one would
dispute the possession of the animal with the child thus
named. Others, however, slit the ear of a foal that has
the colic; the bleeding saves him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Soon after the birth of a foal they hang round his
neck amulets, and talismans (richly ornamented in the
<a id='Page_71'></a>case of wealthy people) and little shells called <i>oudaâ</i>.
They are suspended by neckbands of wool or of camel's
skin (<i>goulada</i>) which the women delight to make with
their own hands, especially applying themselves to harmonise
the colours tastefully. To bay or black horses
they attach a white <i>goulada</i>, to those of a light colour
red <i>gouladas</i>. These neckbands are useful as well as
ornamental, for they serve to hold the animal by if need
be, thus replacing our halters in a manner more agreeable
to the eye and less irksome to the horse. As for the
talismans (<i>heurouze-aâdjab</i>) they are simply little bags
made of Morocco leather, more or less ornamented,
and containing words extracted from the sacred writings,
by means of which they hope to preserve the
animal from wounds, from sickness, and from the evil
eye.</p>

<p class='c009'>Occasionally in war time the foal is killed immediately
after its birth, in order that the dam may be the sooner
fit for service; but never do they slay a filly. Such a
one is weaned and left in the tent to shelter it from the
sun, and the women frequently succeed in saving its life
by giving it ewe's or camel's milk. If a filly be born on
the road during a journey or march undertaken for a
commercial or a warlike object, in order to save it
every possible fatigue it is placed upon a camel, where
a soft nest is constructed for it; but it will only be
allowed to approach its dam during a halt or in the
night time.</p>

<p class='c009'>During the Taguedempt expedition in 1841 I saw a
cavalier of Makhzen, who had no means of transport,
carry before him on his saddle for the first four days
after its birth a filly which his mare had given him at
<a id='Page_72'></a>the bivouac. At the end of that period it followed its
dam, throughout the campaign.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the colts are not destroyed they are usually
sold in the Tell, at the season of buying grain, whereas
the fillies are preserved as a source of riches through
their offspring.</p>

<p class='c009'>The greater the value attached to the mare, the earlier
is the time for weaning, but it generally takes place in
the sixth or seventh month. In weaning the foal they
remove it from its dam, first of all for one day, then for
two, and so on, gradually increasing the period of separation.
To render the transition less abrupt, they give
it camel's milk sweetened with date honey, and to keep
it from wandering in search of its mother they tether it
by its fore or hind-legs with woollen cords but in either
case above the knees or the hocks; whence proceed the
whitish marks that are often observable. If at that age
the animal were fastened by the pasterns considerable
injury might be done. The foal never remaining still
and puzzled by its novel situation, the processes called
by the Arabs <i>louzze</i>, or almonds, would speedily be
formed. Redoubled attention is paid to the foal while
being weaned, for if it succeeded in getting loose and
approached its dam it would be liable to fall ill through
sucking a corrupt and sour milk.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the day time while the mare is on the march or in
the pasture, a sort of halter (<i>kuemama</i>) is put on the
foal, the noseband of which is furnished with short
porcupine's quills. The dam then refuses of herself to
let the foal touch her. As soon as it is fairly weaned, it
is necessary in order to prevent the accumulation of milk
to draw it off from the mare from time to time, and somewhat
<a id='Page_73'></a>to lower her diet. After being weaned, the foal is
fed on ground barley in regularly increasing quantities,
taking care, however, not to cause satiety. They use a
wooden measure called <i>feutra</i>. This measure contains
three double handfuls, and is common to all the tribes of
the desert, because its origin dates from a religious tradition.
At the <i>aïd-es-seghrir</i>, that is, at the little festival
which follows the Ramadan, the Prophet recommends
every Mussulman who is tolerably well off to give to the
poor a <i>feutra</i> of food, wheat, barley, dates, rice, etc.,
according to the productions of the country in which he
may be residing.</p>

<p class='c009'>As soon as the foal is weaned, the women take possession
of it, saying: "It belongs to us now; it is an
orphan, but we will make its life as pleasant as possible."</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c000'>
    <div>REMARKS BY THE EMIR ABD-EL-KADER.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The foal follows the sire. The best stock is that
which proceeds from a sire and a dam of pure extraction.
The produce of a foreign mare by an Arab horse is less
valued, and much less that of a blood mare by a common
horse. Lastly, a colt whose sire and dam are both of
foreign race has no good quality whatsoever.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Arabs affirm that an entire horse has more vigour
and speed than a mare. As a rule stallions are scarce
in the Sahara. They are seldom to be met with except
with the chiefs or with men of wealth, who can afford to
have them properly tended and looked after, as it would
be dangerous to turn them loose on to the grazing
<a id='Page_74'></a>grounds. On the contrary, the mare requires very little
attention, and is therefore chiefly ridden by the Saharenes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Immediately after the foal is born it is made to swallow
two or three eggs. Then, while the foal is still on the
ground they rub the sole and crust of the hoof with salt
dissolved in a preparation of <i>bouna-faâ</i>,<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c011'><sup>[34]</sup></a> which renders
the horn hard and tough. After that, the foal gets up,
gropes  about, and seeks its dam. Twelve hours later it
will follow her to the pasture. As soon as the foal is
born the master of the tent hastens to arrange his ears,
the forelock, the mane, and the neck, carefully collecting
the hairs together from the root upwards. If the
weather is cold, both the dam and the foal are kept in
the tent. Seven days afterwards the mare is made to
swallow a pound or a pound and a half of rancid butter
not salted.</p>

<p class='c009'>The nobler the mare, the sooner is the foal weaned,
and in any case it is never permitted to suck longer than
six months. In certain countries the Arabs are under
the impression that a protracted suckling almost always
produces a bad disposition and a hard mouth. Everywhere,
where it is possible, and according to the season
of the year, they give the foal camel's, or cow's, or ewe's
milk, which is supposed to render the coat more soft and
sleek.</p>

<p class='c009'>"The best treasure of a man is a fruitful mare."</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <a id='Page_75'></a>
  <h2 class='c004'>REARING AND BREAKING-IN</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>Though weaned, the foal accompanies its dam to the
pasture. This exercise is found necessary to its health
and to the development of its faculties. In the evening
it comes home to lie down beside the tent of its owner.
There, it is to every member of the family the object of
the greatest care. The women and the children sport with it,
and give it <i>Kouskoussou</i>,<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c011'><sup>[35]</sup></a> bread, flour, milk, and
dates. This daily contact leads to that docility which is
so much admired in Arab horses.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sometimes tushes grow out even in one-year olds,
and the animal falls away in condition until they are
extracted, when it recovers its health. Should the colt
at the age of fifteen to eighteen months fail to promise
a fine free action of the shoulder, they do not hesitate to
apply the cautery to the scapulo-humeral joint. It is
generally applied in the form of a cross, the four extreme
points of which are joined by a circle. Previous to the
operation care is taken to trace the design with pitch if
the animal be of a light colour, or with plaster if it be
<a id='Page_76'></a>dark. If, again, a colt's knees are ill-shaped, or indicate
a predisposition to bony tumours or to thickening, fire is
applied in three parallel lines. Lastly, if any apprehension
is felt of the colt becoming too straight either in
front or behind, they fire the fetlock joint but only on the
front part, which shows that the Arabs understand the
tendons and treat them carefully. The fire is usually
applied with a sickle. In performing this operation they
avoid as much as possible the great heats of summer.
The most favourable season is the end of autumn or the
beginning of spring: there are fewer flies then, and the
temperature is cooler.</p>

<p class='c009'>The education of a colt should commence when
eighteen months old, because it is the only way to
make him thoroughly docile, and also because the development
of the spleen is thus checked—a very important
point in the opinion of the Arabs. If he is first of all
mounted at a later period, he may look stronger to the
eye, but in reality he will be inferior in patience and in
speed.</p>

<p class='c009'>"Every horse inured to fatigue brings good fortune."<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c011'><sup>[36]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><a id='Page_77'></a>And Heaven knows how the Arab horse is inured to
fatigue! So to speak, he is always on the march. He
travels with his master who is one of the greatest
travellers on horseback in the world. He travels to seek
his food. He traverses long distances to find water; and
this sort of life renders him abstinent, not easily tired,
and ready for anything. It must be admitted that that
is a method of training horses not easily surpassed.</p>

<p class='c009'>I repeat, for I cannot too strongly insist on this capital
point, the opinion of the Arabs is unanimous in favour
of the education of the colt beginning at a very early
age. In acting otherwise, there is a risk, they imagine,
of having an unmanageable horse, or one heavy and
clumsy. Exercise, on the contrary, accustoms the
horse to submission, gives strength to the joints while
rendering them supple, imparts firmness to the bones,
develops the muscles, and brings out that power of
enduring fatigue without which the animal is nothing
more than source of outlay without any return for it.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the age, then, of eighteen to twenty months the
colt is mounted by a child who takes him to water, goes
in search of grass, or leads him to the pasture. Not to
hurt the bars he guides him with a longe, or a tolerably
soft mule's bit. This exercise is good for them both.
The child grows up a horseman, and the colt acquires
<a id='Page_78'></a>the habit of carrying a weight proportioned to his
strength. He learns to walk, to fear nothing, and it
is in this manner, say the Arabs, that "we contrive
never to have restive horses." The first time the child
mounts the colt, he should say, while in the act of
bestriding him: "Glory to Him who has subjected the
horse to us! Without Allah we should never have
accomplished it."</p>

<p class='c009'>It is at this age also they begin to shackle the colt.
The clogs are at first fastened very short, as without
that precaution the young animal might lose something
of the steadiness of its balance and injure its chest or
shoulders either in lying down or getting up again.
They ought likewise to be attached loosely so as not to
occasion the formation of hard knots. This mode of
shackling a horse is decidedly the best. With it one
never hears of a horse breaking loose, a misadventure
that causes such confusion in a bivouac, drives horsemen
to despair, and is the source of a thousand accidents. As
the animal is forced to stoop and lean forwards to graze,
one would imagine that it could not fail after a while
to lose something of its uprightness. The fear is altogether
unfounded. The chest expands, the limbs acquire
strength. All Barbs stand well upon their legs and are
admirably straight along the back and loins. The Arabs
are loud in their abuse of our mode of tying up horses
with a longe. They affirm that in addition to the vices
and accidents it may occasion, it has the great inconvenience
of not allowing the animal to lie down. Whereas
with clogs a horse protrudes his head and neck and
when he wants to sleep places himself exactly in the
position of a greyhound basking in the sun. Besides, a
<a id='Page_79'></a>great many stable vices disappear when they are used.
The animal can neither entangle itself in the halter, nor
slip it, nor get into the manger nor lie down beneath it,
nor scratch the earth with its foot, nor rub against the
manger nor contract any other bad habits of the kind:
an indisputable advantage so far.</p>

<p class='c009'>The colt being thus shackled in front of the tent, a
little negro with a switch is placed near him to accustom
him to remain still. It is the duty of this young slave to
correct him slightly if he attempts to lash out at anything
passing behind him, or if he bites at his neighbours.
He is watched in this manner until he is brought to the
most perfect gentleness. When he is sent to the pasture,
the ligatures fasten together a fore and hind foot at
the same side, and the cord is purposely made very
short. It is observed that when the colt stoops to graze,
the shortness of the cord compels the vertebral column
to remain straight, and to become rather convex than
concave. If, on the contrary, the cord were too long,
there would be nothing to support the vertebral column,
and it would easily become distorted.</p>

<p class='c009'>When from twenty-four to twenty seven months old,
the colt is for the first time saddled and bridled, but
with every precaution. For instance, he is not saddled
until quite used to the bridle. For the first few days
the bit is covered with undressed wool, partly with a
view not to hurt his bars, and partly to allure him to
docility by the saltish flavour of which he is so fond.
When he begins to champ the bit, the task is nearly
accomplished. This preparatory exercise takes place
morning and evening. Thus sagaciously handled, the
young animal will be ready to be mounted in the early
<a id='Page_80'></a>part of the autumn, when he will be less tormented
by the flies and heat. Wealthy owners, before they
allow their colt to be mounted by a grown-up man,
sometimes have him led up and down gently for a fortnight,
with a pack-saddle on his back supporting two
baskets filled with sand. He thus gradually passes from
the weight of the child that first bestrode him to that of
the man who is about to mount him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Suppose the colt now to have completed two years and
a half. His vertebral column has acquired strength.
The clogs, the saddle and the bridle are familiar to
him. A cavalier mounts on his back. The animal is
certainly very young, but he will be ridden only at a
walking pace, and his bit will be a very easy one. The
main point is to accustom him to obedience. The owner
without spurs and holding only a light cane in his hand
which he uses as little as possible, rides him to the
market, or to visit his friends, his flocks and pastures,
and attends to his affairs without exacting anything
more than submission and docility. This he ordinarily
obtains by never speaking to him except in a low voice,
without passion, and carefully avoiding anything likely
to elicit opposition that must result in a contest from
which he might come forth conqueror, but at the expense
of his horse. Particular importance is attached to keeping
the young animal still and quiet for a few  minutes
before letting him start. At a later period, his owner
will not fail to reap the benefit of this excellent practice.</p>

<p class='c009'>The common people sometimes mount their colts before
they are two years and a half old, and if reproached
for doing so, they answer: "You are quite right; we
know that, but how can it be helped? We are poor,
<a id='Page_81'></a>and have no choice but to act in this manner or go on
foot. We prefer the former alternative, notwithstanding
its disadvantages. In the perilous life we lead, the
present moment is everything."</p>

<p class='c009'>Seeing the Arabs employ their colts so early, mounting
the two-year olds and exacting from them considerable
fatigue, and forced marches, and using them even as
pack-horses without regard to their age or strength,
many persons have concluded that this people knew
nothing about the proper mode of managing horses, and
have even denied that they had any love for the animal.
Such persons, however, cannot have taken into account
that sometimes to save their families, sometimes their
property, and frequently to obey the summons of the
holy war (<i>djehad</i>) these Arabs are obliged to use whatever
materials come to hand. They are compelled to employ
their horses through the necessities that beset them, and
through circumstances quite beyond their control, but they
are perfectly aware that it would be better not to do so.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is also when he is about thirty months old that the
colt is taught not to break loose from his rider when the
latter sets foot to earth, and not even to stir from the
spot where the bridle has been passed over his head and
allowed to drag on the ground. Especial care is taken
in teaching this lesson, because it is one of great
importance in Arab life. The same means is adopted in
this case, as in accustoming the colt to the clogs. A
slave stands beside him, who puts his foot on the bridle
whenever the animal is about to go off, and thus gives a
disagreeable shock to the bars of his mouth. After a
few days of this exercise he will stand stock still at the
spot where he has been left, and will wait for his master
<a id='Page_82'></a>for days together. This practise is so universal throughout
the Sahara that the first thing an Arab does after
killing his adversary, if he wants his horse, is to pass
the bridle quickly over his head. The animal then
remains perfectly still and allows the conqueror time to
despoil his fallen foe: without this precaution it would
have rejoined its <i>goum</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Here is a scene we have all witnessed. An Arab
arrives at the market, and dismounts in the midst of a
score of horses or mares. You suppose that he is going
to give his animal to some one to hold. Not so: he
passes the bridle over his neck, lets it fall on the ground,
and placing a stone upon it goes without disquietude to
transact his business. Two hours afterwards he returns,
finds that his horse has not moved from the spot where
he left him—and to which he probably fancied himself
fastened—gets on the saddle and returns to his own
people.</p>

<p class='c009'>From the age of two and a half to three years the
system already indicated continues to be applied with a
view to confirm the young animal in the docile habits so
essential in war time. Pains too are taken to make him
very quiet to mount, by using every precaution. In his
life of perilous adventure the Arab has need, before all
things, of a horse easy to mount. Lessons to this effect
will be renewed day after day until they are no longer
necessary: but not too long at a time for fear of tiring
out the colt. At first the owner will be assisted by two
men, one of whom will hold the bridle and the other the
stirrup, and after a while he will succeed in producing a
statue-like immobility. Sick and ill-shaped horses, say
the Arabs, alone prove unteachable.</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='Page_83'></a>From three to four years old more is expected from a
horse, but at the same time he is better fed. He is now
ridden with spurs and, being thoroughly grounded in
the foregoing lessons, he gives proof of mettle and learns
to fear nothing. The cries of the animals living in the
same <i>douar</i>, the roaring of the wild beasts that prowl
around during the night, and the constant discharge of
fire-arms, soon prepare him for war.</p>

<p class='c009'>However, if notwithstanding all the careful management
we have described, a horse takes to rearing either
through laziness or vice, or to plunging, or biting, or
refuses to leave the tent or the other horses, recourse is
had to the potency of spurs. These are made very sharp,
and their point is bent in the form of a slightly rounded
hook. With these instruments the rider draws long
bloody wheals along the animal's belly and flanks, which
inspire him with such terror that he becomes as tame as
a lamb and will track his master out like a dog. Horses
that have undergone this punishment rarely relapse into
their former faults. To increase the potency of the spurs,
salt or gun powder is rubbed into the still bleeding
wounds. The Arabs are so convinced of the efficacy of
this chastisement that they do not look upon a horse as
thoroughly trained for war until he has passed through
this terrible experience. At the same time that the rider
uses the spurs to chastise a decidedly restive horse, he
strikes him a little behind the headstall of the bridle with
a short thick stick, with which he is always provided
when he means to break in an animal of this kind.</p>

<p class='c009'>In certain localities to prevent a horse from rearing
they attach an iron ring to his ear. If he tries to rise
up a smart blow with a stick is struck upon this ring,
<a id='Page_84'></a>the pain thus caused soon sickening the animal of his
bad "defence." To cure a horse of plunging, he is
mounted with his tail towards a thick thorny shrub
(<i>gandoule</i>). He is then urged forward, but jibs, lashes
out, and pricks himself. However, after a few lessons
of this kind, he breaks himself of his abominable habit.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Arabs declare that spurs add one-fourth to the
rider's horsemanship, and one-third to the spirit of the
animal, and illustrate their assertion by the following
fable:</p>

<p class='c009'>"When beasts were first created, they had the gift of
speech. The horse and the camel took an oath never to
harm one another but to live, on the contrary, with a
perfect mutual understanding. An Arab placed in a
critical position by one of the chances of war, saw with
despair the flight of the camel on which he had hoped to
save his property. There was no time to lose. 'Bring
my horse!' he exclaims, and leaps on his back. He
scolds him, beats him, gives him the heel. All in vain.
The horse stirs not a step, remembering the promise
made to his friend. The Arab then puts on his spurs,
which he carried in his <i>djebira</i>,<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c011'><sup>[37]</sup></a> and the horse, smarting
with his torn flanks, springs forward, and speedily
overtakes the runaway. 'Ah! traitor!' cried the camel,
'thou hast violated our compact; thou tookest an oath
never to do me any harm, and yet thou hast replaced
me in the power of my tyrant.' 'Accuse not my heart,'
replied the horse, 'I refused to move, but "the thorns of
misery" have brought me up to thee.'"</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='Page_85'></a>It is not an easy task to use the spurs properly.
Horsemen who possess that talent are cited even among
the Arabs. Some are only able to urge on their steed
by constantly tickling his flanks without wounding him.
Others are acquainted only with the <i>tekerbeâa</i>, or the
art of clashing their iron spurs against their iron
stirrups in order to frighten the animal. The most
skilful alone know how to raise those bloody wheals to
which we have already alluded. When it is said of a
horseman that he marks his horse with wheals from the
navel to the vertebral column, the highest compliment
has been paid to him. During my residence at Mascara,
how often have I heard the Arabs assert, by way of
vaunting the horsemanship of their Emir: "Abd-el-Kader!
why, he crosses his spurs on his horse's loins!"</p>

<p class='c009'>These spurs are dangerous for inexperienced horsemen,
who sometimes prick the animal on the kneepan
and so lame him if the wound be deep. And if a horse
comes down, the spur is very apt to run into him. For
this reason the Arabs generally have the leathers of
their spurs tolerably loose, in order to obviate by their
slackness, their own awkwardness. It also enables them
to disembarrass themselves more quickly in battle if
their horse happens to be killed and they are compelled
to flee on foot to save their lives. On the same grounds
they prefer in a serious combat loose-fitting shoes to
boots. Our spurs they look upon as utterly inefficient.
"What benefit, in a case where your life is at stake do
you expect to get from them with a horse already
knocked up? They are good only for tickling a horse
and to make him restive. With our spurs we draw
every thing out of him. As long as there is life in him,
<a id='Page_86'></a>we will get it out of him: they lose their effect only in
presence of death."</p>

<p class='c009'>Every Arab trains his own horse. In the Sahara the
only riding masters are practice, tradition, and example.
A reputation as a good rider is only acquired after
many proofs of skilfulness. It is not sufficient to be
competent to manage a horse on level ground. It is
necessary, gun in hand, to make the most of him at a
rapid pace over a broken, wooded, and difficult country,
"Such a one," say they, "is a horseman of the gun, while
so-and-so is only a horseman of the heel." Perfection
implies equal skill with the gun and the heel. They
even go so far as to institute a difference between one
who rides well over dry ground, and one who rides
boldly over slippery ground. They distinguish between
the horseman of summer and the horseman of winter.</p>

<p class='c009'>What experience must not such an apprenticeship lay
up! There is one point, however, which they entirely
overlook—they never trouble themselves as to which leg
the horse puts foremost. An Arab horse as always
power and well formed shoulders which, owing to his
practice as a colt of grazing on mountains, in woods,
and on broken ground, have become far better developed
than they would have been by means of the plate-longe
and the riding school. He is also easy in his paces
because the rider yields to all the movements of his
body and never sets himself against them. I may add
that the Arab has a perfect seat, and though he rides
very short he makes up for that disadvantage by
wearing very long spurs which, by the slightest movement
of the leg, catch the horse on the flank, compel
him to bring his hind-legs under the centre of gravity,
<a id='Page_87'></a>keep him in hand, and place his head as correctly as if
he had acted upon our best system of horsemanship.<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c011'><sup>[38]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>Arab horses have always a good mouth. A proverb
says:</p>

<div class='c023'>The horseman makes the horse,</div>
<div class='c023'>As the husband makes the wife.</div>

<p class='c009'>But it is not enough to have softened and tamed the
horse. Although by means of kind treatment, daily
intercourse, and punishment judiciously applied, he has
become docile, and a good action has been secured, his
education is still incomplete. It still remains to perfect
him, and to do so they train him to the following
exercises:</p>

<p class='c009'><i>El Feuzzâa</i>, "setting off suddenly at full gallop." To
accomplish this they pursue nearly the same method as
ourselves, with this difference that they avail themselves
of the aid of the <i>tekerbeâa</i>, which we have already described,
so that a horse must be altogether impracticable
if he does not act as he is required to do.</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='Page_88'></a><i>El Kyama</i>, "going free." They rush the animal at a
wall, or tree, or a man, and pull him up short. By
degrees he will learn to halt abruptly in the middle of a
rapid career, on the bank of a river or on the edge of a
ravine or precipice—a valuable accomplishment, oftentimes
most advantageous in war. If a young horse is
not a free-goer, but capers about and obstinately refuses
to separate from the other horses, a fault of the last
consequence to an Arab, he is cured by the following
process. The owner's friends get on horseback and
draw themselves up in two lines, facing each other and
two or three paces apart. The horse is then ridden
between these two hedges. If he stops, the horsemen
beat him with sticks, while his rider plies him vigourously
with the spur. A fortnight of this lesson is more
than enough for the most obstinate.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>El Lotema</i>, "the wheeling round." This exercise
consists  in turning suddenly to the right or left, but
more frequently the latter, as soon as the rider has
fired off his piece. The principle is this, the trigger
being pulled, the horseman strikes his horse sharply
with the left hand behind the saddle, and at the same
moment with his right hand on the neck. The animal
understands what is meant, and in a very short time
learns to obey merely the movement of his rider's body.
This instruction is inculcated with the greatest care,
being of great importance to the Arab, who is so often
exposed to single combats.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>El Djery</i>, "the race." They first of all make the
animal go at a swift pace by itself over a level plain,
stimulating it with whip and spur, but only for a short
distance. After a while they match the colt against an
<a id='Page_89'></a>old horse of some renown. The young one becomes
excited, and does his utmost to maintain the contest.
These exercises being frequently repeated serve likewise
to give the owner an exact knowledge of his horse's
capabilities, and of what he may safely undertake with
him in the future. They are not unattended with
danger, but "the angels have two special missions in
this world: to preside at the racing of horses and at the
union of man with woman." It is their duty to preserve
horsemen and horses from all accident, and to see that
marriages are fruitful.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Teneguize</i>, "the leap." Moreover, the colt must be
taught to leap. This teaching is progressive and demands
much patience. The lesson is not repeated more
than twice or thrice in the course of one day. At first
they begin with small obstacles, so as not to disgust
the animal, nor is he brought face to face with any of a
serious nature until he is quite docile and fully developed.
Unquestionably, the Arabs regard the leap as
the necessary complement of a colt's education, but they
are far from attaching to it the same importance that
Europeans do. Their country is for the most part
difficult, full of ravines, strewed with huge stones, and
covered with prickly bushes. They assert, therefore,
that if they were to jump over every obstacle they encounter
either in war or in hunting, they would be
always jumping, which would fatigue their horses
terribly and in the long run ruin them. Consequently,
they go round any very rough ground, ride down
almost perpendicular places, and go straight up the
steepest slopes, and practice renders their horses so
adroit that in a long journey they reach the end more
<a id='Page_90'></a>quickly than if they had jumped over everything that
came in their way.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>El Nechacha</i>, "the exciting." The horse is taught to
throw himself upon that of the adversary, and bite either
the rider or the animal. The rider pulls up his horse,
while he pushes him with his legs, and all the time keeps
on repeating the cry of <i>sheït</i>, and success is the more
easy because the animal is naturally excitable. The
Arabs declare that horses trained in this manner have
often unseated an enemy in single combat. Sometimes,
too, in razzias, they quicken the pace of the camels that
have been captured. I myself have seen a Makhzen
horseman  thus hurry on animals that had fallen behind.
His horse rushed at them and bit at them with apparent
pleasure.</p>

<p class='c009'>Horsemen of renown do not, however, confine the
education of their horses to these manœuvres so necessary
in battle, but they also teach them to shine at feasts
and fantasias by the following accomplishments:</p>

<p class='c009'><i>El Entrabe</i>, "the caracol." The horse walks, so to
speak, on his hind-legs. Scarcely does he touch the
ground with his forefeet, than he again rises. One hand
in concert with the legs, soon trains to this exercise a
horse of fair intelligence.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>El Gueteâa</i>, "the bucking." The horse springs up
with all fours off the ground, the horseman at the same
time throwing up his gun into the air and cleverly
catching it. To obtain this action, the rider marks
certain intervals of rest and works with his legs. He
gives with the animal as he rises, in order to hold him
up when he comes down again. Nothing can be more
picturesque than this exercise. The horses quit the
<a id='Page_91'></a>earth, the guns fly into the air, and the ample folds of
the burnous float and unroll themselves in the wind,
thrown back by the vigourous arms of the children of
the desert. It is, in truth, the charm and crowning act
of the fantasia.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lastly, <i>El-Berraka</i>, "the kneeling." The rider remaining
on his saddle causes his horse to kneel down. This
is the <i>nec plus ultra</i> of the man and the animal. Not
every horse is fit for this exercise. The colt is trained
to it by tickling him on the coronet, pinching him on the
legs, and forcing him to bend the knee. After a time
the horseman will reap the benefit of these preliminary
steps. He need only clear his feet of the stirrups,
stretch his legs forward, turn out the points of his
toes, touch with his long spurs the animal's fore-arms,
and then as his piece is fired at marriage feasts and
other rejoicings, his horse will kneel down amid the
applause of the young maidens, piercing the air with
joyful acclamations.</p>

<p class='c009'>After the horse is completely "suppled" by all these
exercises, the following feats are attempted:</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Laâb el Hazame</i>, "the girdle feat." When the horse
is thoroughly trained, at a family festivals and religious
solemnities, the horseman going at full gallop will pick
up a girdle lying on the ground: the most skilful
grasping it at three different places.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Laâb Ennichan</i>, "firing at a mark." The target is
usually a stone, or a mutton shoulder-blade. The
performers start from a distance in order to get a good
seat, and when fifty or sixty paces off they discharge
their pieces. The Saharene will recall these lessons to
mind when out hunting, and going at full speed, he
<a id='Page_92'></a>brings down an ostrich or a gazelle. It is not of an
inhabitant of the Tell that you must expect these
prodigies of address, skilfulness, and equestrian science.
Nor will you see on him the light apparel, the fine and
beautiful wool of a child of the desert, whom, besides,
you will always recognize by his slender, long-bodied
horse, the ease with which he handles his gun, and that
graceful forward movement by which he quickens his
courser's pace. How many are there in the Tell who
would ride a whole stage without dropping a piece
of money placed between the sole of the foot and the
spur?<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c011'><sup>[39]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>"And you Christians! you go at a trot. And so do we,
but only when time is of no consequence and to breathe
our horses. In war time we know nothing but the walk
and the gallop. If we are not in a hurry, the trot is
enough for us, but if there be danger it is the gallop that
saves our heads."</p>

<p class='c009'>An Arab chief would not keep a horse whose pace
was not formed. The above exercises are not adopted
by all Arabs. Each selects what is best suited to his
position, his fortune, and his tastes. But all conform
themselves to the principles we have laid down for the
education of the colt. These consist in first of all
reducing the young animal to the last degree of wretchedness,
in order to handle him gently when between
three and four years old. After these trials, his real
value is known. These principles are, moreover, summed
up in a familiar proverb that shows the amount of
<a id='Page_93'></a>interest attached to beginning by times the task of
training.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Let the one-year old colt do nothing but eat,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>And he will not strain himself:</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Mount him from two to three years old,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Until he is quite tamed.</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Feed him well from three to four.</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Then mount him again,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>And if he does not suit you,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Sell him without hesitation.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Let it not be supposed, however, that it is only the
Arabs of our African possessions who are so mad, if
I may be allowed the use of the expression, about
commencing the process of breaking-in at an early
age. The Arabs universally, no matter to what country
they belong, profess the same principles. If proof be
wanted, read what has been said on the subject by no
inexperienced person, in fact by an inspector-general of
the Haras, M. Pétiniaud, who was commissioned by the
French Government to travel through Upper Asia to
procure horses of pure Oriental blood. He shall speak
for himself:—</p>

<p class='c009'>"After three years of wanderings among the tribes
encamped from Diarbekir and Aleppo to the confines of
the Nedjed, I returned to Bagdad last January. Among
the papers that awaited me, I found a number of the
<i>Journal des Haras</i>, containing an article on the horses
of the Sahara. The perusal of this only too brief memoir
which denoted such a perfect knowledge of the Arab and
his horse, inspired me with a desire to possess the entire
work. On my arrival in France, you were obliging
enough to send me a copy, for which I thank you. No
one could take a greater interest than myself in a work
<a id='Page_94'></a>which you might safely have entitled: "On the Arab
horse of Asia and Africa;" for such is the spirit of
tradition among this peculiar people that at every line
I recognized in the customs of the Moghreb Arabs the
customs of their ancestors of the Koreish and the Nedjed,
and that after a separation of many centuries."</p>

<p class='c009'>"In 1851 I descended the Tigris from Mosul to Bagdad,
with a volume of Herodotus in my hand. All his descriptions
of men and things were still strictly applicable.
Thus, at a distance of two thousand three hundred
years he depicted the manners of the Arabs with the
same truthfulness with which you, General, have described
in Africa the Arabs of Asia. Time and space are
impotent in the presence of the unchangeableness of such
habits: intestine feuds, the chace, <i>fantasias</i>, love of the
horse, etc., etc., I have witnessed in Asia exactly what
you have written of Africa."</p>

<p class='c009'>"Your work which possesses the great merit of
telling the whole truth and nothing but the truth, is
calculated, as I think, to exercise a great influence on
the education of the horse in France. This delightful
style of reading will develop an interest in the animal in
those who have never before given it a thought, while
our breeders will derive some useful hints from the
numerous details you relate. They will learn not to
reserve their admiration for a horse that has no other
merit than that of being fat, and they will at last come
to understand the advantages that result from putting a
colt to salutary work from his earliest age. "The horse
is a labourer"—let him, then, be accustomed to it in
good time."</p>

<p class='c009'>"I observed that the Arabs used universally to fatigue
<a id='Page_95'></a>without mercy their two and three-year olds, but spared
them from three to four years of age. They say that
sustained work at an early age strengthens the chest,
muscles, and joints of the colt, at the same time
imparting a docility that will remain with him until
death. They also declare that as soon as these rude
trials have been got over, his constitution should be
developed by rest, care, and an abundant diet, because
after this new stage of life he will only be able to show
himself exactly what he really he is—good or bad. If
good, they will keep him: if bad, they will get rid of
him without hesitation, for in their eyes a bad horse is
not worth the barley they give him."</p>

<p class='c009'>I trust to be pardoned for this digression for the sake
of the reflections which it suggests. Is it not wonderful
to behold a people scattered over vast territories, from
the Persian Gulph to the Atlantic Ocean, without means
of communication, without printing machines, without
telegraphs, without any one of the thousand appliances
of modern civilization, but still speaking the same language,
living in obedience to the same law, and
preserving by simple tradition as well as we could do by
books, the usages, the manners, and even the precepts
of their ancestors? While seeing and interrogating
the Arabs of Algeria, I saw and listened to the Arabs of
the primitive stock. Is not this oneness, under such
circumstances, a matter to create astonishment?</p>

<p class='c009'>It may happen that after a horse's education is finished,
vices will occasionally break out. The Arabs, however,
pay little attention to these, because they consider that
such faults proceed simply from too long a period of rest
which renders them of lazy habits, or subject to caprice
<a id='Page_96'></a>through excess of vitality. They correct them by work,
the fatigues of war and the chace. The convenient
disposition of their saddles enables them to keep their
seat in spite of the obstinate "defences" of the animal,
they are consequently never taken by surprise, nor
frightened, and always end by mastering the animal
completely. No one ever thinks of getting rid of his
horse because he rears or plunges or is otherwise
troublesome. On the contrary they take delight in these
proofs of spirit, for the time will come when they will
find their advantage in it. The Arabs have a saying
that "The horseman who has not known how to train
his horse, bestrides death every day."</p>

<p class='c009'>The individual to whom they attribute the honour of
having been the first to tame the horse is Ishmael, the
common ancestor of all the Arabs. Their authority is
these words of the Deity: "We placed horses under his
dominion in order that he might ride them"—and the
celebrated invocation of Ishmael himself: "Horses,
night, and space are my witnesses, as well as my sabre,
my pen, and paper." Always, always, religious tradition.</p>

<p class='c009'>As to the really bad vices of biting, plunging, and
kicking, they are almost unknown. In fact, all their
efforts are directed to avert these. They make the
horse live close to the tent, and receive him in some
degree as an integral part of the family. In the midst
of the women, the children, and the slaves, he can
hardly fail to acquire habits of gentleness and docility.
For the rest, this care shown to the horse is not merely
the result of a sense of personal interest on the part of
the owner: it takes its origin in religion. The Prophet
<a id='Page_97'></a>has said: "The Believer who has trained his horse to
shine in the holy war, the sweat, the hair, the very
excrement of this animal shall be placed in the balance
to his favour at the day of the last judgment."</p>

<p class='c009'>However, notwithstanding all these bonds which
attach man to the horse, notwithstanding the solidarity
formed by habit, religion, and interest, no Mussulman
will ever give to his horse the name of a man. Men's
names have been borne by saints; it would therefore be
a deadly sin, a sacrilege, in fact, to apply them to any
animal, even though he should be the noblest of all.
Besides, names of any kind are given solely to illustrious
steeds, and only in the tents of the great. The following
are some of their designations:—</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Rakib</i>, the Scout; <i>Mansour</i>, the Victorious; <i>Sabeur</i>,
the Patient; <i>Salem</i>, the Saviour; <i>Kamil</i>, the Perfect;
<i>Saâd</i>, Happiness; <i>Maârouf</i>, the Known; <i>Aatik</i>, the Noble;
<i>Sabok</i>, the Rapid; <i>Nadjy</i>, the Persevering; <i>Moubarek</i>,
the Blessed; <i>Guetrâne</i>, Pitch; <i>Messaoud</i>, the
Happy; <i>Safy</i>, the Pure; <i>Ghezala</i>, the Gazelle; <i>Naâma</i>,
the Ostrich; <i>Mordjana</i>, Coral; <i>El Aroussa</i>, the Bride;
<i>Djerada</i>, the Locust; <i>Ouarda</i>, the Rose; <i>Guemera</i>, the
Moon; <i>Hamama</i>, the Dove; <i>Yakouta</i>, the Ruby; <i>El
Guetaya</i>, the Cutter; <i>Aâtifa</i>, the Docile; and <i>Leïla</i>,
Night. Very similar names are given to slaves.</p>

<p class='c009'>A constant practice of the Arabs, and one that must
have been remarked by all who have served in Africa, is
to cut the hairs of the forelock, the neck, and the tail.
The rules for this seem odd to Europeans. When the
colt is one year old they clip off all his hair except a tuft
between the ears, on the withers, and on the dock of the
tail. At two years old the operation is repeated, but
<a id='Page_98'></a>this time the hair is entirely clipped off. When three
years old, in the third spring, a third clipping takes
place. From three to five years the hair is allowed to
grow, but only that the whole may be clipped off at the
termination of the fifth year. This final operation is
called <i>el halafya</i>, and no instrument is ever again raised
against the hair. It would be thought sinful to do so,
as the only object could be to deceive one's brethren as
to the age of the horse. After each clipping they never
fail to rub the parts thus exposed with sheep's dung
soaked in milk, or with Prussian blue diluted with
melted butter. These applications soften the skin and
thicken the hair. The practice of clipping is supported
by several reasons. In the first place, it indicates, at
sight, the age of a horse up to eight years, as it takes at
least three years before the horse, having recovered his
full length of hair, can be styled <i>djarr</i>—one that trails
his tail along the ground. Secondly,—which is an
important point in hot countries,—it compels the animal
to bear patiently the stings of flies. And lastly it is
supposed that the hair thus becomes thicker, longer, and
more silky.</p>

<p class='c009'>If the Arabs explain and justify this method of clipping
a horse's coat until it is five years old, they do not
attempt to do so for our fashion of docking a horse's tail.
In their eyes it is a barbarism that has no name. It
affords an inexhaustible theme for raillery. They rally
us, indeed, on this subject in the most serious conjunctures.
I can corroborate this assertion by an incident
for the accuracy of which I personally vouch:—</p>

<p class='c009'>In 1841 the column commanded by Marshal Bugeaud
marched to Taguedempt to destroy the fort erected there
<a id='Page_99'></a>at great expense by the Emir Abd-el-Kader. We were
encamped on the Ouad-Krelouk one of the tributaries of
the Mina. In the course of the night we were awakened
by the report of a musket shot fired in the middle of the
camp. Every one rushed out of his tent, hastened in
the direction of the sound, and inquired what was amiss.
An Arab was lying on the ground, with his thigh broken.
He held in his hand a small knife with a very sharp edge
and, like all professional thieves in that country, he had
nothing on save a leathern girdle furnished with a pistol.
The sentinel who had fired explained that having
observed a bush approach, halt, and then approach still
nearer, he had suspected some trickery and so fired at it
at ten paces distance, just as it was close to the horses
of his captain. On hearing the tale of the African
veteran, his comrades in their fury were about to
massacre the Arab, but the officers who were present
calmed their not unnatural excitement and reported the
case to the superior authorities. The Arab was carried
without delay to the ambulance and had his wound
dressed. On the morrow the expedition resumed its
march. The fellow had received a very severe wound,
and it was useless to embarrass ourselves with him. To
have put him to death would only have hastened his
destiny, perhaps, by a few days, without doing us any
particular good, and, besides, the adventure could be
turned to a better account. The Governor General
decided, therefore, that he should be left upon the site of
the encampment, and that a letter should be entrusted to
him for the powerful tribe of the Flittas, upon whose
territory we then happened to be. In this letter clear
intimation was given to that hostile people that their
<a id='Page_100'></a>furious dislike to us would one day be fatal to themselves;
that it was useless to contend with us, that
France abounded in warriors and in wealth, that Abd-el-Kader
by continuing the struggle would only bring
upon them unnumbered woes; and lastly that the best
thing they could do, was to draw off from that man,
unless they preferred to see their rich harvests destroyed
and burnt before their very eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>At early dawn the column set out, and the rearguard
was not a thousand <i>metres</i> from our bivouac when they
observed some Arab horsemen arrive, dismount, and
carry off the wounded man. On the following day we
received the reply of the Flittas. It was addressed
to "General Bugeaud, Kaïd of the Port of Algiers," and
was couched to the following effect:—</p>

<p class='c009'>"You tell us that you are a strong and powerful
nation, and that we cannot contend against you. The
powerful and the strong are just. And yet you seek to
take possession of a country that does not belong to you.
Besides, if you are so rich, what do you propose to do
among a people who have nothing but powder and shot
to give you? Moreover, when it pleases Him, the Master
of the world humbles the strong and exalts the feeble.
You threaten to burn our crops, or to devour them with
your war horses and beasts of burden. How often
already have we experienced similar calamities! We
have had bad seasons, we have had locusts and drought,
but Allah has never forsaken us; for we are Believers,
we are Arabs, and privations will not kill an Arab.
We will never yield to you. You are the enemies of our
religion. It is quite impossible. Nevertheless, if the
Almighty, to punish us for our own sins and for those of
<a id='Page_101'></a>our forefathers, should be pleased to inflict upon us some
day that horrible malady, we confess we should be
greatly embarrassed. With us the mark of submission
is the presentation of a horse to the victors. We are
aware that you care only for horses with short tails, and
our mares do not produce such."</p>

<p class='c009'>Subsequently, however, the Flittas were compelled to
give us such horses as their mares did produce; but their
resistance was obstinate. Since then they have always
been the first to raise the cry of war and rebellion. It
was they who slew the brave General Mustapha-ben-Ismaïl.<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c011'><sup>[40]</sup></a>
It was they who supported Bou-Maza. It was
they, in short, who were the last reduced to submission.</p>

<p class='c009'>After this episode so characteristic of our African
campaigns, I cannot better conclude this chapter on the
education of the colt than by giving some entirely novel
details as to the manner of treating horses in Arabia,
which will not be at all out of place and may be interesting
to many as showing the part played by woman
in the life of that noble animal.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have often heard it asked whence come the gentleness,
<a id='Page_102'></a>the address, the intelligence which, every one is
agreed, are to be met with in Arab horses. Are these
qualities inherent in the Oriental stock? or are they the
result of education? A genial climate is undoubtedly
favourable to the development and improvement of the
equine race. A rich and noble stock is naturally more
apt than any other to yield what is demanded of it, but
at the same time something must be done for it in
return. The most fruitful soil will produce nothing but
briars and thorns if it is not cultivated, and that in a
proper manner. Starting from this standing point the
Arabs apply themselves with the greatest care and the
utmost tenacity to perfect, in their horses, the gifts of
nature. A sustained education, daily contact with man,
with the other animals, with external objects, that is their
grand secret—it is that which makes the Arab horse what
he is, an object worthy of our unexceptional admiration.
I am aware that this feeling of admiration has not been
altogether general. Imperfect knowledge has led many
to accuse the Arabs of being ignorant and even of acting
like butchers in the matter of horses. They rode them
badly, and did not bestow upon them the sort of care so
prized in Europe; they abused them from their most
tender years, and were constantly drawing blood from
the flanks or from the mouth, etc., etc. But truth at
length began to dawn, and when it was ascertained that
all their horses were intelligent, obedient to the hand
and leg, quiet to mount, and inaccessible to fear, there
was no choice but to acknowledge that these were great
qualities which could only have been produced by a
sound and logical education.</p>

<p class='c009'>Our horses, on the other hand, are nothing more than
<a id='Page_103'></a>animals more or less tamed. They bear with man as a
conqueror who disposes of them, but they have neither
confidence nor affection for those who employ them.
Slaves of mankind in general, they do not attach themselves
to any one man in particular, because no man
especially attaches himself to his horse, which is merely
tended and valued like any other agricultural product
that is sold as soon as possible, or like an article of
commerce, or a piece of furniture that is bartered for
profit or exchanged from caprice. Our dogs, it may be,
are only attached to us because we do not part with
them for a price.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Arabs desire to find, in their horse, a devoted
friend. With them he leads, so to speak, a domesticated
life, in which, as in all domestic life, women play a
conspicuous part—that, in fact, of preparing by their
gentleness, vigilance, and unceasing attention, the
solidarity that ought to exist between the man and the
animal. On a journey or a campaign, far from the
dwelling place, it is the rider who occupies himself with
his horse. But at the encampment, under canvas, and
in time of repose, it is the wife who directs, superintends,
and feeds the noble companion in arms who so
frequently augments the reputation of her husband while
supplying the wants of her children. In the morning it
is the wife who brings him his food, and tends him, and
if possible washes his mane and tail. If the ground on
which he stands happens to be uneven, broken, or
covered with stones, she removes him to a spot more
convenient for his repose and the just disposition of his
weight. She caresses him, passes her hand gently over
his neck and face, and gives him bread, or dates, or
<a id='Page_104'></a>kouskoussou, or even meat cooked and dried in the sun.
"Eat, O my son!" she says to him in a soft and tender
tone. "One day thou shalt save us out of the hand of
our enemies and fill our tent with booty."</p>

<p class='c009'>It is in the morning also that the Arab wife goes forth
to the pastures to gather for the animal she cherishes an
ample supply of herbs esteemed in the desert for their
tonic and nutritive properties. On her return should she
see any children, as yet too young to reason, amusing
themselves by teasing or ill using the horses tethered
in front of the tent, she will cry to them as soon as she
can make herself heard: "Children, beat not the horses.
Wretches! it is they who nourish you. Do you wish
that Allah should curse our tent? If you begin again, I
will speak to your father."</p>

<p class='c009'>On this subject the Arab wife is so intractable that she
would not spare her own husband if he took no care of
his horse. The horse is his honour, his fortune. She is
proud and jealous on those points, and deems herself
affected by whatever affects him. If it ever came to
pass that her remarks and suggestions were passed over
with neglect, she would not hesitate to carry her
complaints to the chief of the tribe: "O my lord! you
know that our horse is all we have, and yet my husband
takes him on idle journeys, ill uses him, overrides him,
and taxes him beyond his strength. It would be something
if he looked after him when at home; but no, his
covering is full of holes, he is never certain of being fed,
and even goes in want of water. Scold my husband, I
beseech you in the name of Allah. Lead him back into
the ways of our forefathers. Above all, do not tell him
that it was I who suggested this to you."</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='Page_105'></a>The Arab chief, whose interest it is in the course of
his adventurous career to be followed only by well
mounted horsemen, never fails to make use of the
information thus given. He will summon the delinquent
before him, reprove him, and warn him that if he
does not change his conduct he will take his horse from
him and make him walk like a common foot-soldier. At
last he will discharge him with these words: "Thou
understandest me; go thy way; but bear in mind that in
this world honour begins at the stirrup to be completed
in the saddle." A lesson of this kind always produces a
great effect, not only on the offender but on all who
might be tempted to follow his example. And in this
manner, sometimes through self-love, sometimes through
the fear of punishment, the Arabs apply themselves to
inculcate, voluntarily and compulsorily, on all characters
and dispositions a love for the horse.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the afternoon, a little later or a little earlier
according to the season, the wife employs herself in
leading the horses to water if the fountain be not too
distant, and in that case she goes herself to fetch the
water in goat-skin bags. When water fails entirely,
she gives them ewe's or camel's milk. At this hour the
tent of an Arab chief presents a truly singular spectacle.
Oftentimes may be seen between the legs of the women
and the horses, in presence of a crowd of picturesquely
attired children, by the side of falcons beating their
wings or greyhounds in a state of excitement, a gazelle,
an antelope, or an ostrich, running in and out and
jumping about, to beg a drop of that liquid so rare in
the desert but which is nevertheless given in abundance
to the favourite of the family. Now the evening is at
<a id='Page_106'></a>hand. What means that dark speck on the horizon? It
is the young men of the <i>douar</i><a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c011'><sup>[41]</sup></a> wearily regaining the
encampment, mounted on horses with hollow flanks,
worn out, and shoe-less. They have been out the whole
day hunting, without eating or drinking. Camels loaded
with gazelles, hares, bustards, etc., follow behind, but
this prize, tempting though it be, will not save them
from the storm that awaits them: "Young men," their
mothers will exclaim with an angry voice, "it is disgraceful
thus to ruin our horses for the sake of a little
useless game. You would do far better to spare them
for the day when the saliva will dry up in the mouth,
for the day when riches will not ransom the head."</p>

<p class='c009'>During the great heats the women bring the horses
into the tent, to shelter them from the fierce rays of the
sun. They wash and cleanse them, and in the evening
fill the nose-bags with barley to hang round the neck of
their petted animals. Each one, and it is a very
important point, receives a ration proportioned to his
age and temperament and the work he has gone
through. These every day attentions and kindnesses
as we have already remarked and can not too often
repeat, render the horses gentle and affectionate. They
neigh with pleasure at the approach of her who tends
them, and, as soon as they see her, turn their head
gracefully towards her. They go up to her, and she
lays hold of them whenever it pleases her, and if any
one expresses surprise she will reply with perfect simplicity:
"How can you suppose that our mares will not
recognize the hand that caresses and feeds them? To
how many gambols do they not betake themselves in
<a id='Page_107'></a>my presence? And when rising up on their hind-feet
behind my back they gently rest their legs on my
shoulders—and when they carry a young lamb in their
teeth by its wool—and when they slip into the tent to
steal our kouskoussou—these are all associations very
dear to us. Besides, is it not I who, by giving them at
proper times milk or barley, have succeeded in tightening
their bellies, developing their chests, sharpening
their heads, widening their foreheads, and hardening
their limbs? Behold them pass by the side of a herd of
gazelles and you would see no difference between the
one and the other: the same grace, the same vigour in
their bounding, the same swiftness in the course. Like
the gazelles have they not eyes level with the head,
large eyeballs, bold, sharp ears, thin legs, a rounded
croup, and hoofs hard and well knit?"</p>

    <div>REMARKS BY THE EMIR ABD-EL-KADER.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The details touching the education of the colt are true.
It is what we really do. Too great fatigue and too long
journeys do not suit the colt because they prevent the
development of his strength and stature. The <i>djeda</i>, or
less than three years old colt is like a shrub—any
impediment in his way stops his growth. But what
does suit the colt is exercise and a cautiously graduated
fatigue. He must be accustomed to the saddle and
bridle, but should only be ridden by a child or by a
man of discretion whose weight is in proportion to the
age and strength of the animal.</p>

<p class='c009'>A very customary kind of exercise is after this manner.
<a id='Page_108'></a>The colt is mounted by a child, who, with a light stick
in his hand, sets off at full gallop. When the colt is
tired, he stops, and browses, and lies down as soon as he
returns home. On the following morning they give him
a feed of barley and take him back to the same starting
point, whence he again sets off. This time he is
expected to go a greater distance, and in this manner
they continue until they have obtained from him a
course twice as long as that of the first day.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Arabs look for a free-going pace in a young
horse, and they demand three varieties of gallop; 1st a
short gallop, such as is usual in taking a ride for
pleasure; 2nd a strong and regular gallop, useful in war,
or in hunting wild beasts; 3rd a gallop at full speed, as
in races or in fleeing for one's life. This last should not
be too freely indulged in.</p>

<p class='c009'>In fine, the education of the colt should be commenced
very early. This is an excellent practice, and not to
conform to it is disgraceful—it is making a horse unfit
for war. An animal that is not thoroughly trained from
its earliest years is intractable, difficult, and awkward:
with the slightest exertion it bursts out into a sweat
and is good for nothing. It is therefore incumbent in
sparing the colt, as I have already said, whatever may
check his growth and the full development of his
proportions, to endeavour to obtain by work a horse that
is supple and patient of fatigue.</p>

<p class='c009'>The first horse possessed by the Prophet was called
<i>Ouskoub</i>, by reason of his speed, for the word <i>sakab</i>
denotes water that escapes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Another horse belonging to the Prophet was named
<i>Mortadjez</i>, because of the beauty of his neigh which
<a id='Page_109'></a>resembled poesy and the harmonious metres of the
<i>Aadjaz</i>. He was of a white colour, and was also styled
"Gracious" and "Noble."</p>

<p class='c009'>A third was known as the "Trailer," as if he trailed
his tail along the ground. A fourth was <i>El Hezzez</i>, "the
fixed" or "the adherent," as if he were already fixed and
adherent at the goal it was proposed to reach. Others
affirm that his name referred to the vigourous set of his
limbs. A fifth was named the "Hill," either because of
his height, or because of the power and hardness of his
limbs. The Prophet's sixth horse was called the "Rose,"
on account of the colour of its coat, which was a cross
between a chestnut and a dark bay. The seventh was
named the "Swimmer," because of the beautiful movements
of his shoulders, and because in galloping he
raised his fore-legs as if he were swimming.</p>

<p class='c009'>His first horse, <i>Ouskoub</i>, was his favourite. He had
besides these the "Sea," the "Wolf," etc., etc.</p>

<p class='c009'>It has been my object in recalling to mind these
notices to teach the Arabs the rule they ought to follow
in naming their horses, which should always be called
after those of the Prophet. <i>Djarada</i>, a javelin,—<i>Delim</i>,
male ostrich,—<i>Rakib</i>, vigilant (the wild ass), are likewise
designations suitable to horses.</p>

<p class='c009'>There are three kinds of horses: the first loads with
crimes and belongs to Satan; the second preserves from
eternal fire and belongs to man; the third brings down
rewards and belongs to Allah.</p>

<p class='c009'>Loads with crimes and belongs to Satan the horse
that is trained out of pride and ostentation, and kept to
support wagers to play at games of hazard, or to do
injury to Mussulmans.</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='Page_110'></a>Preserves from the fire and belongs to man the horse
reared for the purpose of reproduction, to save his
owner from poverty, and to be useful to him in his
personal affairs, without his wandering from the way of
God.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lastly, draws down rewards and belongs to Allah
the horse destined exclusively for good works, in the
interest of religion. The grass eaten by such a horse in
the field or the garden, his evacuations, the water he
drinks with his master on his back while crossing a
river, without even any intention on the part of the
latter to give him to drink, are inscribed by Allah in the
register of good works.</p>

<p class='c009'>Remonstrate with your horses, and they will avoid the
faults which have brought down your anger upon them,
for they understand the wrath of man. Treat them,
however, habitually with great gentleness; and when
you mount them, fear not to guide them into the midst of
a crowd or of uproar. Let them hear the report of fire-arms,
the <i>guellal</i> (the tabour), the shouts of men, and
the cries of camels; let them see everything, too, which
appears strange to them, and in a short time they will
manifest neither surprise nor terror.</p>

<p class='c009'>A man of a noble family of the Oued-Shelif<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c011'><sup>[42]</sup></a> setting
out for Mecca, started in company with a few friends who
wished to do him honour. He was riding a blood mare,
still in the possession of the family. Suddenly she
stumbled, and to punish her he gave her a smart cut
with his bridle end, which put her into such a state of
agitation that for some minutes she did nothing but rear
and jump about from right to left. On his return from
<a id='Page_111'></a>Mecca he rode the same animal, and the friends who had
accompanied him on his departure went forth to meet
him and give him welcome. Scarcely had they reached
the spot where the mare was beaten than she began to
rear and caper about, going through absolutely the same
movements as on the day she was struck. Every one
was astonished at this proof of extraordinary memory in
an animal that had preserved for a whole year the
recollection of a punishment, and of the place where she
received it.</p>

<p class='c009'>"Our noble coursers pass their time in vying with
each other in swiftness."</p>

<p class='c009'>"The women wipe off with their veils the sweat that
runs down their faces."</p>

<p class='c009'>"They balance their heads as if they would free themselves
from the fastenings that hold them captive, and
are attentive to the slightest command."</p>

<p class='c009'>"On their backs are mounted fierce lions."</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <a id='Page_112'></a>
  <h2 class='c004'>DIET.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>If in the Sahara ewe's or camel's milk is frequently
given to horses, it must not be supposed that that is
their only drink. It is more generally a substitute for
barley, which is a scarce commodity, than for water,
which is not usually difficult to find. The Arabs are
convinced that milk maintains health and strengthens
the fibre, without increasing the fat. It is needless to
add that the rich who possess many she-camels are less
sparing of milk than the poor, who have hardly enough
to satisfy the wants of their families. The latter dilute
it with water when they can. In the spring time they
make use of ewe's milk, to which at other seasons they
add camel's milk.</p>

<p class='c009'>At Souf, Tougourt, Ouargla, Metlili, Gueleâa, and in
the Touat, where there are more camels than horses and
where grain is scarcer than in the first zone of the
desert, dates oftentimes take the place of barley. When
they are dry they are given in a nosebag. In eating
them the horse, of himself, rejects the stones with
considerable address. In certain districts the stones are
taken out and crushed in a mortar, and are then mixed
<a id='Page_113'></a>with the dates, which are likewise slightly bruised.
Dates are also given to horses before they are perfectly
ripe, and are eaten stones and all—being quite soft they
do no harm. When it is desired to mix the dates with
the drink, the Arabs proceed after this fashion. After
the fruit is gathered they take three or four pounds of
fresh dates, and manipulate them in a large vase full of
water until the pulp of the date has become a sort of
liquid paste. The skins and stones are removed and
the mixture after being well shaken is presented to
the animal. The date regimen makes fat, but does
not harden the fibre.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the first zone of the Sahara the ordinary diet of the
horse is as follows for each season:—In the spring
the shoes are generally removed, and the animals are
turned out on the pastures, which at that period of the
year abound with a succulent and fragrant herbage
known under the generic name of <i>el âacheub</i>. They are
clogged. Care is taken to avoid the districts where the
<i>ledena</i> is met with, a velvety plant the leaves of which
resemble a rat's ear. It grows close to the ground and
is usually covered up and hidden in the sand. It brings
on colics that for the most part terminate fatally.
Persons of distinction who keep many servants, and
experienced horsemen, never give green food to their
war horses. Rich or poor, no one gives barley, which
is replaced by ewe's milk, which in this season is very
abundant, and preserves the horse in perfect condition.
The animals are watered only once a day, at two in the
afternoon.</p>

<p class='c009'>In summer the Saharenes proceed to the Tell to lay
in their provision of grain. They are surrounded by
<a id='Page_114'></a>unfriendly strangers, and sometimes by enemies. They
do not, therefore, care to send their horses out to graze,
as they would run the risk of being stolen. Nor are
they sorry to have them close at hand in case of any of
the numerous accidents happening which so often occur.
Barley and barley straw are purchased from their hosts:
it is the period of the year when the animals fare most
liberally. I mention barley straw, because no Arab
would ever consent to feed his horses on fresh wheaten
straw. They fancy it produces jaundice if used before
the winter. If, perchance, any thing should prevent
them from going to buy grain in the Tell, as the plains
afford no herbage but what is dried up by the sun, they
make for the mountains of the Sahara, where there is a
better chance of coming across rivers, or ponds, or at
least marshes. If this resource fails them, they encamp
in the neighbourhood of the <i>Kuesours</i><a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c011'><sup>[43]</sup></a> where straw can
be had for money or in the way of barter. In either case
the mares alone are sent out to graze, the horses being
fastened in front of the tents. Whatever be the temperature,
the Arabs never give their horses that mixture of
bran, barley meal, and water which we call a mash, and
of which we make such a mistaken use. They accuse
it of relaxing the tissues and of weakening the system,
while favouring the growth of fat, an evil they dread
above all things. When their horses are over heated
they lessen their work, and if they can procure it they
give them green barley straw, and if that is not to be
had they have recourse to cooling baths. As to the
barley, they like it heavy, without any bad smell, and
free from the dirt which gets mixed with it in the "silos,"
<a id='Page_115'></a>as well as from the black, withered, and blighted grains
which have been struck by the South wind.</p>

<p class='c009'>In autumn the horses are again turned out into the
pastures, where they find the <i>shiehh</i>, that invaluable
resource of the Sahara, so that it is said in praise of a
man who is as capable as he is modest:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>So-and-so is like the shiehh:</div>
      <div class='line'>He has parts, but is no prattler.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>So much for the day. At night are given handfuls of
<i>seurr</i>, a species of thorny shrub. It is cut down close to
the ground, and beaten with a stick to get rid of the dry
prickles, which might injure the œsophagus, or the
membranous lining of the stomach. It contains many
nutritive elements. Another plant somewhat resembling
the common bramble and called <i>el âdem</i> is prepared in a
similar manner.</p>

<p class='c009'>The horse is watered only once in the twenty-four
hours, about two in the afternoon. That time is thought
the most favourable because the water will have lost
something of its coldness,—the temperature then falling
every day. Those who are well off give barley, but the
poor cannot always do so.</p>

<p class='c009'>In winter the horses continue to be sent to the
pastures, which are now verdant in proportion to the rain
that has fallen. The <i>shiehh</i>, the <i>âdem</i>, the <i>derine</i>,<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c011'><sup>[44]</sup></a> etc.,
are met with, and afford a very sufficient diet. At night
<i>bouse</i> is thrown to them in quantities. It is called by the
Arabs "brother of the barley," so highly do they appreciate
<a id='Page_116'></a>its nutritive properties. <i>Bouse</i> is in fact, nothing
else than the <i>alfa</i>,<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c011'><sup>[45]</sup></a> which, at the moment of forming its
ear, having been pulled by its upper part has come away
and got separated from its sheath. Being gathered into
small sheaves it is cut up in pieces and answers the
purpose of chopped straw. The <i>alfa</i> is turned to account
in yet another manner. Its roots are laid bare with a
mattock and being freed from their reddish coating, are
eaten with avidity by the animal. This article of food
takes the name of <i>gueddeine</i> or <i>zemouna</i>, according to
the locality. It is nutritious, but not a substitute for
barley. Hay is unknown in the desert. The Arabs
might, if they chose, lay up an abundant supply of it for
the winter, but they reject it as having a tendency to
make a horse heavy, to soften the fibre, and in the long
run to occasion inflammatory disorders. The animals
are watered only once a day as in autumn. It is a
proverbial saying with the Arabs that "The food of the
morning goes out into the draught, while that of the
evening passes into the croup." They affirm, therefore,
that if the horse has drunk sufficient over night, and
eaten heartily through the night, there is not the
slightest inconvenience in not giving him anything on
the morrow, especially if he has to set out early in the
morning. Thus in our camps, with fifteen to eighteen
hundred Arab horsemen making part of the expedition,
what did we witness? Every officer of the old African
army can vouch for the truth of what I am about to say:</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='Page_117'></a>Contrary to our habits, to the very last moment the
most perfect tranquillity continued to reign in the Arab
bivouac. Not a minute was taken from the rest of the
animal. They gave him nothing either to eat or to drink.
The instant before starting they rubbed him down with
a nose-bag. The saddle replaced the covering worn
through the night. The bridle was put on, the tents
struck, the morning prayer offered up, and at the hour
named they were on the march. More than once I have
happened to testify my surprise at such a system, but
always received the same reply: "Why wouldst thou
do for thy horse what thou wouldst not do for thyself?
If thou leavest the table at ten or eleven at night, canst
thou sit down again to it on the morrow at the dawn of
day?" With this regimen the animals remain thin and
slender. They are always ready to march or gallop, or
do whatever hard work may be required of them. They
pick up in an astonishing manner when instead, of a few
handfuls of barley and what they can graze off plains
parched by a burning sun, they fall in with the produce
of the Tell. How would it be, then, if they were placed
on the diet of European horses? Instead of their flesh
being firm they would get quite fat, and so gain in our
estimation, but they would lose in that of the Arabs, who
little appreciate that style of beauty generally acquired
at the cost of the best qualities of a war horse.</p>

<p class='c009'>However, if the Arab is too genuine a horseman not
to attach the greatest importance to vigour, he is on the
other hand too fond of pomp and distinction and the
<i>fantasia</i>—to use a word already popular in Europe—not
to bestow upon himself, when he can, the luxury of
a horse for show and parade. It is therefore no rare
<a id='Page_118'></a>thing to see Arabs of high position leave their favourite
mares for three or four months fastened in front of their
tents, without putting them to any work. They thus
get into good condition, and are employed only at
festivals and marriage feasts and on occasions when the
chiefs are particularly anxious to distinguish themselves.
For the chace, for razzias, and for long and arduous
journeys, they keep horses of less apparent value, but of
which they are sure, and do not fear to fatigue them.
The mares to which we have alluded are equipped with
great ostentation. The <i>stara</i>, or cloths, and the bridles
are embroidered with pure gold, the stirrups are plated
or gilt, and the felt saddle-cloths are as fine as cloth;
the most esteemed coming from Ouareglâa.</p>

<div class='nf-center c000'>
    <div>REMARKS OF THE EMIR ABD-EL-KADER.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>One of the Prophet's companions as he went out one
morning found him wiping with his cloak the head of
his horse. "Why, with thy cloak?" "What know'st
thou?" replied the Prophet. "It may be that the Angel
Gabriel has been angry with me on his account last
night." "At least let me give him his food." "Ah!"
cried the Prophet, "Thou would'st take for thyself all
the rewards, for the Angel Gabriel has told me that
every grain of barley eaten by the horse is accounted to
me for a good work."</p>

<p class='c009'>The Saharene gives his horse camel's milk to drink
which has the particular property of imparting speed, so
that a man—according to what is said by reliable
<a id='Page_119'></a>persons who guarantee the truth of the statement—if he
takes nothing else for a sufficient time, will attain to such
a degree of swiftness that he may vie with the camels
themselves. In fact, camel's milk strengthens the brain
and the tendons, and does away with fat, which
produces a relaxation of the muscles.</p>

<p class='c009'>In some parts of the Sahara the chiefs and horsemen
of renown never give green food to their war horses.
Milk, barley, and the plants known by the names of
<i>shiehh</i>, <i>derine</i>, <i>bouse</i>, and <i>seuliane</i> form their sole keep.
This diet does not enlarge the belly or fatten like green
food, which distends the intestinal canal, partly because
of the enormous quantity consumed by the animal before
he is satisfied, and partly because of the water it
contains.</p>

<p class='c009'>In summer the horses are not watered until three
o'clock in the afternoon. In winter they are watered
rather earlier—from noon to one. It is the time of
day when in the open air the water has lost much of
its coldness. These principles are expressed in the
following proverb, known to the meanest horseman of
the desert:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>In the hot season<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c011'><sup>[46]</sup></a> put back the hour of the watering-place</div>
    <div>And put forward that of the nose-bag;</div>
    <div>In the cold season put forward the hour of the watering-place,</div>
    <div>And put back that of the nose-bag.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Among the desert tribes, for forty days counting from
the month of August, the horses are watered only every
other day. The same method is pursued during the last
twenty days of December and the first twenty days of
<a id='Page_120'></a>January. In cold weather the rich let their horses have
as much barley as they can eat, but decrease the ration
considerably in hot weather. Milk and <i>bouse</i> may be
substituted for barley. It is seldom that any thing to
eat is given in the morning. The horse marches upon
the food of the previous evening, and not on that of the
same day.</p>

<p class='c009'>Looking at two horses, one from the Tell and the
other from the Sahara, a man who has not studied the
subject will always prefer the former, which he will find
handsome, heavy, sleek, and fat, while he will despise
the second, fool that he is, and abuse the very points
which constitute his worth—that is, the fine, dry
extremities, the tightened belly, and the bare ribs. And
yet this horse of the desert that has never been accustomed
to barley, green food, or straw, but only <i>shiehh</i>,
<i>bouse</i>, and <i>seuliane</i>, that has never had any thing but
milk to drink and from his earliest years has served at
the chace and in war, will have the swiftness of the
gazelle and the patience of the dog, while the other will
never be any thing but an ox by his side.</p>

<p class='c009'>The greatest enemies of the horse are repose and fat.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <a id='Page_121'></a>
  <h2 class='c004'>GROOMING, HYGIENE, PROPORTIONS.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>Grooming is unknown in the Sahara. The horses are
merely wiped down with woollen rags, and covered with
very good <i>djellale</i>, or rugs that envelop both the croup
and the chest. In truth, labour of this sort is little
wanted, the horses being habitually placed in a healthy
spot, on raised ground, and sheltered from draughts.
Arabs who have observed us grooming our horses
morning and evening with elaborate carefulness, pretend
that this continual rubbing of the epidermis, especially
with the curry-comb, injures their health, and renders
them delicate and impressionable, and consequently
incapable of supporting the fatigues of war, or at all
events more liable to disease.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the weather is hot and facilities exist for the
purpose, the horses are washed morning and evening.
Frequently in winter time they are fastened up inside
the tents, which are very roomy, to shelter them from
the sun and rain. The great thing is to keep them
clean. One day a horse was led up to the Prophet who
examined it, rose up, and without saying a word, wiped
his face, eyes, and nostrils with the sleeves of his
<a id='Page_122'></a>under-garment. "What! with your own garments!"
exclaimed the bystanders. "Certainly," replied he;
"the Angel Gabriel has more than once rebuked me,
and has commanded me to act thus."</p>

<p class='c009'>In winter the covering is kept on day and night; and
in summer until three o'clock when it is taken off, but
put on again at eight for the whole night, to preserve
the animal from cold and dew, which are all the more
dangerous, say the Arabs, because the skin has been
heated throughout the day by a burning sun. The
following proverb expresses their dread of the cold of
summer nights:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The cold of summer</div>
      <div class='line'>Is worse than a sabre cut.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>If the Arabs do not, like ourselves, attach much importance
to grooming, they are, on the other hand, very
careful and particular in their choice of the food, and
above all of the water, they give to their horses. Many a
time during the early days of the conquest, while on an
expedition, after long marches in an intolerable heat,
with a south wind blowing that choked us and drove
the dust and sand into our faces, when horse and foot
alike panting, exhausted, without power of motion, we
delivered ourselves up, worn out as we were, to a
fatiguing sleep often interrupted by the alerts caused by
the enemy prowling around us—at such a time I have
seen the natives go a league from the bivouac in order
to water their horses at some pure spring known to
themselves. They preferred to risk their own lives to
experiencing the pain of watering their horses at the
scanty rivulets in the encampment, quickly converted
<a id='Page_123'></a>into filthy drains by the trampling of men and beasts of
burden.</p>

<p class='c009'>It can hardly be necessary for me to dilate any farther
on the hygiene of the horse among the Arabs. Indeed,
I could only repeat what I have already said. It seems
to me preferable to refer the reader to the various
details scattered through the preceding pages, and
particularly to the principles enunciated in the chapter
on the education of the colt. If I have made myself at
all understood, I have shown how every owner of a horse
among the Arabs is an active, vigilant, I had almost
said devoted, master who watches and directs the progress,
corrects the defects, and perfects the qualities
of his pupil from the very first day. This education
embraces every thing, including what I may fairly call
the moral faculties; and it augments, modifies, and improves
the physical qualities. Every thing is weighed
and foreseen. The drink, the diet, the exercise, the
position in rest, the whole is graduated and proportioned
to age, place, and season; it is all the object of incessant
and sustained solicitude. Moreover, the grand
principle, and I myself think it a good one, seems to be
to avoid, on one hand, excessive fatness which is opposed
to all energetic work, and, on the other, any check to
perspiration which is the cause of the greater number of
diseases. Once more, the question is not: is all this care
well founded? are they wrong, or are we mistaken? But
after having propounded the formula, that in the life of
an Arab his most absorbing and almost exclusive occupation
is the rearing and training of his horse, I have
shown that the Arab is not guided by mere chance, that
his is not a blind, inconsiderate passion, as is supposed
<a id='Page_124'></a>by those who see him from afar and bestow only a glance
on him. Any one who will study him perseveringly,
who will examine him, as it were, under the microscope,
and analyse his daily acts and doings, will be forced to
the conclusion that he is guided by traditional and
logical motives. In a word, this education, this careful
bringing up, of the horse is based upon fixed and
constant principles having for their aim to endow the
animal with spirit, bottom, and health. And what is
this but hygiene?</p>

<p class='c009'>The Arabs, says Ben-el-Ouardy, have always preferred
good horses to their own children, and they love so much
to show them off on occasions of rejoicing that they
would deprive themselves of all nourishment rather than
see them suffer from hunger and thirst. In the arduous
and critical circumstances of life, especially in years of
famine, they go so far as to give them the preference
over their own persons and families. This is proved
both by faithful narratives, and by the chaunts composed
by their poets. Witness the verses addressed by the
learned Ben-Sassa to the great tribe of the Beni-Aâmer.<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c011'><sup>[47]</sup></a></p>

    <div>Whose eyes flash fire!</div>
    <div>Love horses, take care of them,</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>In the Sahara, then, the horse is the noblest creature
after man. The most honourable occupation is to rear
<a id='Page_126'></a>him, the most delightful pastime is to mount him, the
best of all actions is to tend him well.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Arabs assert that they can tell beforehand, by
certain methods, what will be a colt's stature and
character when he becomes a horse. These methods
vary in different localities, but those most generally
adopted are the following:—For the height, they
take a cord, and passing it behind the ears and the nape
of the neck, they bring the two ends together on the
upper lip just below the nostrils. Having established
this measure, they apply it to the distance from the foot
to the withers. It is an article of belief that the colt
will grow as high as this last measurement out-tops the
withers.</p>

<p class='c009'>When it is desired to ascertain the value of a horse by
his proportions, they measure with the hand from the
extremity of the dock to the middle of the withers, and
take note of the number of palms. They then begin
again from the middle of the withers to the extremity of
the upper lip, passing between the ears. If in the two
cases the number of palms is equal, the horse will be
good, but of ordinary speed. If the number of palms
behind is greater than in front, the horse will have no
"go" in him. But if the number of palms between the
withers and the extremity of the upper lip is more
considerable than in measuring from the tail to the
withers, rest assured the animal will have great qualities.
The more the number differs to the advantage of
the forepart, the greater will be the value of the horse.
With such an animal, say the Arabs, they can "strike
afar"—go a long distance—thus expressing the pace
and bottom promised by such proportions. With a little
<a id='Page_127'></a>practice they easily come to judge by the eye so as to
have no occasion to measure. While a horse is passing
they compare rapidly, starting from the withers, the
hindpart with the forepart, and without going into details
the animal is judged.</p>
<p class='c008'>REMARKS BY THE EMIR ABD-EL-KADER.</p>

<p class='c009'>Passing before a horse the Prophet began to rub his
face with his sleeve, saying: "Allah has been wrathful
with me because of horses." "Felicity is attached to the
forelocks of horses." And it is on their account that their
owners can reckon on the aid of Allah. Therefore it
is your duty to wipe their forelocks with your hands.
A wise man has said:—"The noble labours with his
hands without a blush, in three cases; for his horse, for
his father, and for his guest."</p>

<p class='c009'>One mode of judging of a horse is to measure him from
the root of the mane close to the withers and descend
to the end of the upper lip between the nostrils. They
then measure from the root of the mane to the end of the
tail-bone, and if the forepart is longer than the hindpart
there is no doubt the horse will have excellent qualities.
To ascertain if a young horse will grow any more or
not, the Arabs measure first from the knee to the highest
point situated in the prolongation of the limb above the
withers, then from the knee downwards to the beginning
of the hair above the coronet (to the crust of the hoof):
if these two measures are to one another as two-thirds to
one-third, the horse will grow no more. If this proportion
<a id='Page_128'></a>does not exist, the animal has not done growing, for
it is absolutely necessary that the height from the knee
to the withers should represent in a full grown horse
exactly double the length of the leg from the knee to the
hoof.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the desert the curry-comb is never used, the horses
are cleaned with the nose-bag, which is made of horse
hair, and are frequently washed if the weather is favourable.
Milk is their ordinary drink. Should it happen to
run short, the Arabs do not hesitate to go a considerable
distance to find clear and pure water for them. The
barley ought to be heavy, very clean, without any bad
smell, and completely clear of the impurities which are
unavoidably mixed with it in the "silos." The horses
are covered with good <i>djellale</i>, which fully protect the
loins, the belly, and the chest. They are manufactured
in the tribe. Those that are made with care are water
proof.</p>

<p class='c009'>There are some coats which must be preserved with
equal attention from cold and from heat. Experience
has demonstrated that this is necessary for all horses of
a light colour, beginning with the white, the fineness of
whose skin makes him very susceptible.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>In the sun he melts like butter:</div>
      <div class='line'>In the rain he melts like salt.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Coats of a dark colour do not need so many precautions.
When it is very hot or very cold, the horses are
brought inside the tent. In the Sahara the nights are
always cool; in summer, as in winter, the animals must
be covered. Nothing is overlooked that may avert
checked perspiration. After a long journey the saddle
<a id='Page_129'></a>is not removed until the horse is dry. Nor do they give
him any thing to eat until he has recovered the regularity
of his breathing, and for the most part they give
him water to drink with the bridle on. Lastly, the
encamping grounds are studiously selected. What is
preferred is a dry ground, cleared of the stones that
might encumber it, on which the horse is placed so that
the forequarters shall be a little higher than the hind
quarters, and facing as much as possible the master of
the tent, who watches him night and day like one of his
own children. To place a horse with his forequarters
lower than the hind quarters is to ruin his shoulders.
Particular care should always be taken of the <i>djellale</i>.
A horseman is little respected by the Arabs when it can
be said of him:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

<div class='chapter'>
  <a id='Page_130'></a>
  <h2 class='c004'>COATS.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>The favourite coats are:—</p>

<p class='c009'>The White: "Take the horse white as a silken flag,
without spot, with the circle of his eyes black."</p>

<p class='c009'>The Black: "He must be black as a night without
moon and stars."</p>

<p class='c009'>The Bay: He must be nearly black, or streaked with
gold. "The dark red one said to the dispute, 'Stop there.'"</p>

<p class='c009'>The Chestnut: "Desire a dark shade. When he flees
beneath the sun, it is the wind. The Prophet was
partial to chestnuts."</p>

<p class='c009'>The Dark Dappled-Gray, called "the grey of the wild
pigeon," if resembling the stone of the river.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

    <div>He will fill the douar</div>
    <div>When it is empty,</div>
    <div>And will preserve us from the combat,</div>
    <div>On the day when the muzzles of the guns touch each other.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The Grays are generally esteemed when the head is of
a lighter colour than the body.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Green, or rather the yellow dun, which must be
dark, with black tail and mane.</p>

<p class='c009'>White is the colour for princes, but does not stand
<a id='Page_131'></a>heat. The black brings good fortune, but fears rocky
ground. The chestnut is the most active. "If one tells
you that he has seen a horse fly in the air, ask of what
colour he was; and if he replies: 'Chestnut,'—believe
him." "In a combat against a chestnut, you must have
a chestnut." The bay is the hardiest and most sober.
"If one tells you that a horse has leaped to the bottom of
a precipice without hurting himself, ask of what colour
he was; and if he replies: 'Bay,'—believe him."</p>

<p class='c009'>Ben Dyab, a renowned chief of the desert, who flourished
in the year of the Hijra 955, happening one day
to be pursued by Saad-el-Zenaty, sheikh of the Oulad-Yagoub,
turned to his son and asked: "What horses are
in the front of the enemy?" "White horses," replied his
son. "It is well; let us make for the sunny side, and
they will melt away like butter." Some time afterwards
Ben Dyab again turned to his son and said: "What horses
are in the front of the enemy?" "Black horses,"
cried his son. "It is well; let us make for stony ground,
and we shall have nothing to fear—they are the negroes
of the Soudan, who cannot walk with bare feet upon the
flints." He changed his course, and the black horses
were speedily distanced. A third time Ben Dyab asked:
"And now, what horses are in the front of the enemy?"
"Dark chestnuts and dark bays." "In that case," exclaimed
Ben Dyab, "strike out, my children, strike out,
and give your horses the heel, for these might perchance
overtake us had we not given barley to ours all the
summer through."</p>

<p class='c009'>The coats despised are:</p>

<p class='c009'>The Piebald: "Flee him like the pestilence, for he is
own brother to the cow."</p>

<p class='c009'>The Isabel, with white mane and tail; no chief would
condescend to mount such a horse. There are some
tribes even that would not consent to allow him to remain
a single night with them. They call such a one
<i>sefeur el ihoudy</i>, "the Jew's yellow." It is a colour that
brings ill luck.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>The Roan; this is called <i>meghedeur-el-deum</i>, "a pool of
blood." The rider is sure to be overtaken, but will never
overtake.</p>

<p class='c009'>The horse is to be valued that has no white spots
except a star on the forehead, or a simple white stripe
down the face. The latter must descend to the lips, and
then the owner will never be in want of milk. It is a
fortunate mark. It is the image of the dawn. If the
star is truncated or has jagged edges, it is universally
disliked, and if the animal adds to that a white spot in
front of the saddle no man in his senses would mount it,
nor would any judge of horse-flesh deign to possess it.
Such a horse is as fatal as a subtile poison. If a horse
has several white spots, three is the preferable number—one
of the right feet should be exempt, but it matters
not whether it be behind or before. It is a good sign
to have stockings on both the off forefoot and the near
hindfoot. It is called,</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='Page_133'></a>The master of such a horse cannot fail to be fortunate,
for he mounts and dismounts over white. The Arabs, it
must be remembered, generally mount on the off side
and alight on the near side. Two hind stockings are a
sign of good fortune;</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>

      <div class='line'>The horse with the white hind-feet,</div>
      <div class='line'>His master will never be ruined.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>It is the same with white forefeet—his master's face
will never turn yellow. Never buy a horse with a white
face and four stockings, for he carries his winding-sheet
with him. The prejudices of the Arabs on the subject of
white spots are summed up in the following little story:</p>

<p class='c009'>"An Arab had a blood mare. There was a dispute
beforehand as to what her foal would be. So when she
was on the point of foaling he invited all his friends to be
present. The head first of all came in sight—it bore
a star. The Arab rejoiced. His horse would one day,
outstrip the dawn, for he had the mark on his forehead.
Next appeared the near forefoot, when the owner in
ecstasy demanded one hundred <i>douros</i> for the foal. The
off forefoot then showed itself with a stocking, and the
price was reduced to fifty douros. After that came the
near hindfoot. It also had a stocking, and the Arab
overjoyed, swore that he would not part with his foal
for the whole world. But lo! the fourth foot presents
itself likewise with a stocking, when the dweller in the
Sahara cast the animal out, in his fury, on the refuse-heap,
unable to bring himself to keep such a brute."</p>

<p class='c009'>A horse has forty white <i>Tufts</i>, of which twenty eight
are generally considered as being of neither good nor bad
omen, while to the remaining twelve a certain influence
<a id='Page_134'></a>is attributed. It is agreed on all hands to regard six of
these as augmenting riches and bringing good fortune,
and the other six as causing ruin and adversity.</p>

<p class='c009'>The tufts of good omen are:</p>

<p class='c009'>The tuft that is between the two ears, <i>nekhlet el aâdar</i>,
"the tuft of the head stall": such a horse is swift in the
race.</p>

<p class='c009'>The tuft that grows on the lateral surface of the neck,
<i>sebâa enneby</i>, "the finger of the Prophet": the owner will
die like a good Mussulman in his bed.</p>

<p class='c009'>The tuft of the Sultan, <i>nekhlet essoultan</i>. It runs
along the whole length of the neck, following the
tracheal artery: love, riches, and prosperity. The horse
that bear this offers up three prayers every day:</p>

<p class='c009'>"Allah grant that my master may look upon me as the
most precious possession he has in the world!"</p>

<p class='c009'>"May Allah give unto him a happy lot, so that mine
may benefit by it!"</p>

<p class='c009'>"May Allah grant unto him the happiness of dying a
martyr upon my back!"</p>

<p class='c009'>The tuft on the chest, <i>zeradya</i>, fills the tent with
plunder.</p>

<p class='c009'>The tuft where the saddle-girths pass, <i>nekhlet el
hazame</i> multiplies the flocks.</p>

<p class='c009'>The tuft on the flank, <i>nekhlet eshebour</i>, "the tuft of the
spurs." If it is turned towards the back, it preserves the
rider from misadventure in war: if it is turned towards
the belly, it is a sign of riches for its master.</p>

<p class='c009'>The following white tufts bring misfortune:</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Netahyat</i>, a tuft over the eyebrows: the master will
die, shot through the head.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Nekhlet el nâash</i>, the coffin tuft, grows close to the
<a id='Page_135'></a>withers and goes down towards the shoulder. The rider
will not fail to perish on the back of such a horse.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Neddabyat</i>, the mourners; a tuft on the cheek; debts,
tears, ruin.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Nekhlet el khriana</i>, the thieves' tuft. It is close to the
fetlock joint, and night and morning it prays: "O Allah!
grant that I may be stolen, or that my master may die!"</p>

<p class='c009'>The tuft by the side of the tail announces trouble,
misery, and famine.</p>

<p class='c009'>The tuft on the inner part of the thigh: women,
children, flocks, all will disappear.</p>

<p class='c009'>Such is the classification generally adopted. It is not,
however, absolute, for it varies according to localities,
each tribe increasing or diminishing the number of its
lucky and unlucky tufts. It will be seen that I have
alluded only to the principal coats without entering upon
the gradation of shades, which would have carried me
too far astray. Making every allowance for prejudice
and superstition, it is clear that the Arabs are fond of
dark and decided colours, while they look upon light
and faded colours, as well as white spots upon the head,
carcase, and limbs, if broad or long, as signs of weakness
and degeneracy of race. Every Arab has his own
favourite coat. Some like black horses and others gray,
while others again affect bays or chestnuts. Their
preferences and antipathies are usually based on family
associations. With such a coat their ancestors achieved
a brilliant success—with such another they encountered
a grievous calamity. They will thus often refuse a good
horse, without giving any other reason than "It is not
my colour."</p>

    <div><a id='Page_136'></a>REMARKS BY THE EMIR ABD-EL-KADER.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The horse the most esteemed is a black one with a
star on his forehead and white spots on his feet. Then
comes the blood-bay, and after that the dark chestnut.
Horses of other coats are placed on the same line with
the exception of the piebald, with which the Arabs will
have nothing to do.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Prophet has said: "If thou wouldst go to the
war, purchase a horse with a star on the forehead and
stockings on all his legs with the exception of the right
forefoot."</p>

<p class='c009'>A horse with white feet, his off foreleg being alone
of the colour of his coat, resembles a man who carries
himself gracefully in walking, with the sleeve of his
cloak floating in the air.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Prophet has said: "If I were to gather together
in one spot all the horses of the Arabs, and make them
race against one another, it is the chestnut that would
outstrip the rest."</p>

<p class='c009'>According to the traditions of our Lord Mohammed the
black horse is superior in the beauty of its mould and
in its moral qualities, but the chestnut in fleetness. The
Arabs have a saying: "If thou hast a chestnut, bring him
along. If thou hast only a sorry chestnut, still bring
him."</p>

<p class='c009'>In a spacious arena constructed for races, cast thy eyes
over the assemblage of noble coursers.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thou wilt see the one who, arriving the first at the
goal, has removed his master's anxieties.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then the second who followed close at hand;—they
<a id='Page_137'></a>both reached the goal without slackening their speed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Every horse of noble race fascinates the eyes and rivets
the gaze of the enthusiastic spectator.</p>

<p class='c009'>One of a rose colour, whose coat resembles the red
tints which the setting sun leaves on the horizon.</p>

<p class='c009'>Another of a white colour, like to a shooting star
hurled against the evil genii.</p>

<p class='c009'>A third, a blood-bay, of incomparable beauty and tall
stature, in whom may be recognized traces of his paternal
and maternal uncles, famous in the annals of racing.</p>

<p class='c009'>There may also be seen a bright bay with a skin like
gold.</p>

<p class='c009'>And then a chestnut that pleases the eye with its shining
mane.</p>

<p class='c009'>Or another, black as night, adorned only with a white
star on the forehead, that shines like the first light of
dawn. Oh! blessed is the horse with white stars and
stockings!</p>

<p class='c009'>The Prophet abhorred a horse that has white marks on
all its legs. The horse with a white mark that does not
come down to the tip of the upper lip, accompanied by a
stocking on the off forefoot, bears upon him the signs of
the most evil omen. Thus, whosoever sees him prays
to Allah to avert from himself the calamity announced
by this animal. He is like the "hour poison."<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c011'><sup>[50]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>The fleetest of horses is the chestnut; the most enduring,
the bay; the most spirited, the black; the most
blessed, one with a white forehead.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Arabs distinguish forty knots or tufts in a horse.
Of these, twenty eight are without any significance in
their eyes, and are of neither good nor bad omen. To
<a id='Page_138'></a>twelve of them alone do they ascribe an influence allowed
by tradition and confirmed, as they think, by personal
observation.</p>

<p class='c009'>"Horses are eagles mounted by riders tall as a lance;
they arrive, cleaving the air like a falcon swooping on
its quarry."</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <a id='Page_139'></a>
  <h2 class='c004'>ON CHOOSING AND PURCHASING HORSES.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>In the Sahara horses that are celebrated for their
blood and speed sell easily and at a good price. There
are blemishes that totally exclude a horse from serving
in war. Such as <i>el maateuk</i>, a narrow and hollow chest
accompanying lean and perpendicular shoulders. It is
difficult to form an idea of the importance attached by
the Arabs to the development of the muscles of the
chest.</p>

<p class='c009'>Another blemish is fatness and want of prominence in
the withers. You can never fix the saddle properly on
such a horse, nor handle him boldly in galloping down
hill. Again, the jardens "father of bleaching" (of the
beard): curbs, when too far gone; ring-bone; spavin,
especially when it is near the saphena; the processes
known as <i>louzze</i>, or "almonds," on the ribs, and <i>fekroune</i>,
or "tortoise," on the forequarters; splints, if near the
back sinew; the pastern prolonged and bent; the pastern
short and upright; windgalls along the tendons; and a
long and concave back, are all serious objections. An
animal is also rejected if he cannot see at night, or when
there is snow. It is discovered by the manner he raises
<a id='Page_140'></a>his feet when it begins to grow dark. The defect may
be ascertained by placing a black surface before him in the
day time—if he steps upon it without hesitation, there
is no doubt on the subject. As the Arab passes much of
his life-time in making nocturnal marches to surprise his
enemy, or to escape from him, what could he do with
such an animal?</p>

<p class='c009'>Let us pass on now to the faults or blemishes which,
though generally dreaded, do not prevent a horse from
changing masters. These are narrow nostrils—they
will leave you in trouble; long, soft, and pendant ears;
and a short, stiff neck. A horse is little worth that does
not lie down, nor one that switches his tail about while
in quick motion; also horses that scratch their neck
with their feet, that rest on the toe of their foot, that
over-reach themselves in trotting or galloping, or that
cut themselves by knocking their feet together. To discover
if a horse cuts himself, pass the two wrists, joined
together, between his two fore-arms and place them
below his breast. If they are touched by the inner part
of the fore-arms, be sure that the animal has too narrow
a chest and cannot help cutting himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>Distrust a horse that wets his nose-bag in eating his
barley, and that seems to sip the water with the tips of
his lips. An ambler is not fit for a chief: it is the horse
of such as "clash the spurs," (carry messages). Beware
of a horse that rears, refuses the spurs, bites, is difficult
to mount, and breaks away from his rider when the latter
dismounts: these are all grave faults in war time. Leave
to the pack-saddle a horse that is deaf. You will know
him by his hanging ears, void of expression, and thrown
backwards, and also by his not answering to any sound
<a id='Page_141'></a>of the voice. By sight, by smell, by hearing, a horse
will warn his master of coming danger, if he does not save
him from it. He saith:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Preserve me from what is in front,</div>
      <div class='line'>I will preserve thee from what is behind.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>"The lion and the horse disputed one day as to whose
eyesight was the best. The lion saw, during a dark
night, a white hair in milk, but the horse saw a black
hair in pitch. The bystanders pronounced in favour of
the latter."</p>

<p class='c009'>The highest virtue in a horse is endurance, to which,
in order to constitute a perfect animal, must be joined
strength. A horse is considered strong if he clears
fifteen to sixteen foot-lengths in his first bound. If he
covers a greater space he is deemed to be of superior
strength, but if he clears no more than eight to ten feet
he is set down as a heavy animal. A very fiery horse
never exhibits patience of fatigue; nor one whose legs
are lanky, neck too long, and buttocks too heavy to be
in harmony with other parts of his body; nor one who
lacks vigour in his heels. Such a horse, after a long
course, will be exhausted in his legs, so that when he is
pulled up by his rider he will still take several steps
contrary to the latter's wishes. A horse that has neither
patience nor mettle is easily recognised. The form of
his body is irregular, his chest narrow, and his breathing
short. Strength and wind are the two highest qualities
of a horse. The absence of either is likely to affect his
endurance and lower his spirit.</p>

<p class='c009'>"Look in a horse for speed and bottom. One that has
speed alone, and no bottom, must have a blemish in his
<a id='Page_142'></a>descent; and one that has bottom alone and no speed,
must have some defect, open or concealed.</p>

<p class='c009'>"Reject a horse high in the middle, with a narrow
chest, flat ribs, and lanky limbs and that is for ever
fidgetting about and holding up his head. If you give
him his head, he says: 'Hold me in!' and if you hold
him in, he says: 'Let me go!'</p>

<p class='c009'>"But if in the course of your life you alight upon a
horse of noble origin, with large, lively eyes, wide apart,
and black, broad nostrils, close together; whose neck,
shoulders, haunches, and buttocks are long, while his
forehead, loins, flank, and limbs are broad; with the
back, the shin-bone, the pasterns, and the dock short;
the whole accompanied by a soft skin, fine, flexible hair,
powerful respiratory organs, and good feet with heels
well off the ground—hasten to secure him if you can
induce the owner to sell him, and return thanks to Allah,
morning and night, for having sent thee a blessing."</p>

<p class='c009'>Never burden yourself with an animal that is broken-kneed,
diseased, or wounded, though they assure you
that it is only a temporary accident. Recall to mind the
saying of your ancestors;</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Ruined, and son of a ruined one,</div>
      <div class='line'>Is he who buys to cure.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>It is no uncommon thing for an Arab to buy a horse
in partnership with another. The usual conditions of
such a compact are after this fashion. An Arab sells
a mare to another for 100 <i>douros</i>, but receives only
50 <i>douros</i> in payment, the balance representing his
share in the animal. The purchaser rides the mare
about, and makes use of her for war, the chace, and for
<a id='Page_143'></a>his private journeys. If he make a razzia, three-fourths
of the plunder belong to himself, and one-fourth to his
partner. Should the mare be killed in war, in an expedition
mutually agreed upon, the loss falls upon them
equally. But should death overtake her at a fantasia, a
wedding, or any other festival, the purchaser is alone
answerable—he has to make good 50 <i>douros</i> to the
vendor. If the animal, however, is killed in front of the
tent, suddenly, or under the horseman, while the latter
is defending his wife, his children, and his flocks,—the
circumstances were beyond his control, and he is not
called upon for any reimbursement.</p>

<p class='c009'>Should the mare produce a colt, it is reared until it is
a year old, when it is sold, and the proceeds equally
divided between the partners. On the other hand, if the
mare has produced a filly, the latter is valued when a
year old, and the vendor has the privilege of choosing
the filly or the dam, paying or receiving the difference
of value. This sort of compact is never made with
respect to horses.</p>

<p class='c009'>An Arab who wishes to sell a horse will never consent
to be the first to name a price. Some one comes up and
says: "Sell; thou wilt gain." The vendor replies:
"Buy; thou wilt gain."</p>

<p class='c009'>"Speak thou first."</p>

<p class='c009'>"No, speak thou."</p>

<p class='c009'>"Was he purchased, or reared?"</p>

<p class='c009'>"Reared in my tent, like one of my own children."</p>

<p class='c009'>"What hast thou been offered for him?"</p>

<p class='c009'>"I have been offered 100 <i>douros</i>."</p>

<p class='c009'>"Sell him to me at that price—thou wilt gain. Tell
me, then, what thou asketh."</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='Page_144'></a>"See what is written with Allah."</p>

<p class='c009'>"Come, let us drive away the previous bidder, and do
thou take 10 <i>douros</i> over and above his offer."</p>

<p class='c009'>"I accept. Take thy horse, and Allah grant thou
mayst be successful upon his back as many times as he
has hairs upon it." And should he be desirous to avoid
all risk of future annoyance on the subject of warranty,
he adds in the presence of witnesses: "The separation
between us is from this very moment. Thou dost not
know me, and I have never seen thee."</p>

<p class='c009'>It is not permitted to mount a horse for a trial until
after the price has been agreed upon. Nevertheless,
before the bargain is completely concluded the animal
is tested against a horse that has a certain local reputation.
The mode of trial is somewhat singular. The
riders are barefooted, and are not allowed to touch their
horse with the heel during any part of the race.</p>

<p class='c009'>Horses whose reputation is well established in the
country are never sold in the market-place. It is a
positive insult to an Arab to ask him, "wilt thou sell thy
horse?" before he has made known his intentions. "They
must think me then in a miserable condition," he will say,
"that they should dare to make such a proposal to me."</p>

<p class='c009'>Certain tribes are particularly addicted to traffic in
horse-flesh. The most noted of these Arab horse-dealers
are the Beni-Addas. It is said of them:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>With others, horses are mere carrion,</div>
      <div class='line'>With them, they are youthful brides:</div>
      <div class='line'>With others, they are asleep,</div>
      <div class='line'>With them, they dance.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>For the rest, the Arab is no horse-dealer after the
European fashion. He never makes use of ginger, nor
<a id='Page_145'></a>does he resort to any trickery to disguise the bad points
of his horse. He simply places him before the purchaser.
But for the fraud he disdains he substitutes a flow of
seductive eloquence. His inexhaustible oratory pours
itself forth in metaphors and hyperboles. Pointing to
the animal, he will say: "Uncover his back and satisfy
thy gaze."</p>

<p class='c009'>He will then go on:</p>

<p class='c009'>"Say not it is my horse; say it is my son. He outstrips
the flash in the pan, or a glance of the eye. He
is pure as gold. His eyesight is so good that he can
distinguish a hair in the night time. In the day of
battle he delights in the whistling of the balls. He
overtakes the gazelle. He says to the eagle: 'Come
down, or I will ascend to thee!' When he hears the
voices of the maidens, he neighs for joy. When he
gallops he plucks out the tear from the eye. When he
appears before the maidens he begs with his hand. It is
a steed for the dark days when the smoke of powder
obscures the sun. It is a thoroughbred, the very head
of horses! No one has ever possessed his equal. I
depend on him as on my own heart. He has no brother
in the world: it is a swallow. He listens to his flanks,
and is ever watching the heels of his rider. He understands
as well as any son of Adam: speech alone is
wanting to him. His pace is so easy that on his back,
you might carry a cup of coffee without upsetting it. A
nosebag satisfies him, a sack covers him. He is so light
that he could dance on the bosom of thy mistress without
bruising it."</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='Page_146'></a>Ben-Youssouf, having one day given in exchange for
a mare of the desert twenty she-camels with their young
replied to his father who had keenly rebuked him: "And
why are you angry, my lord? Has not this mare
brought me the agility and the softness of skin of the
jerboa, the movement of the neck of the hare, the
fleetness and the vision of the ostrich, the hollow belly
and the limbs of the greyhound, and the courage and
breadth of head of the bull? She cannot fail to turn
yellow the face of our enemies. When I pursue them,
she will plunder without ceasing the croups of their
horses; and if they pursue after me, the eye will not
know where I have passed!"</p>

<p class='c009'>It will be seen, as I had previously indicated in
tracing the outline of a thoroughbred horse as sketched
by the Arabs, that they esteem it of consequence that in
his form he should borrow certain details from other
animals. He should unite in himself the qualities that
are separately remarked in the gazelle, the greyhound,
the bull, the ostrich, the camel, the hare, and the fox.
It is agreed that he should have the long, clean limbs of
the gazelle, the fineness and strength of its haunches,
the convexity of its ribs, the shortening of its fore-legs,
the blackness of its eyes, and the straitness of its armpits,
He should also recall to mind the length of the lips and
tongue of the dog, the abundance of its saliva, and the
length of the lower part of its fore-paws. They go so
far as to regard this resemblance of the horse to the
greyhound as a means of guiding inexperienced purchasers:
at least, such appears to be the moral of an
anecdote widely circulated among them.</p>

<p class='c009'>"Meslem-ben-Abou-Omar, having learned that one of
<a id='Page_147'></a>his relatives was travelling near the banks of the
Euphrates, desired to avail himself of this opportunity
to obtain one of the famous horses of that country. His
relative knew nothing about horses, but was very fond
of the chace, and had some very fine dogs. Despatching
a servant with proper instructions, Meslem informed his
relative that the form of the horse he wished for corresponded
to that of the best of his greyhounds. An
animal was thus procured, the like of which the Arabs
have never since met with."</p>

<p class='c009'>Merou-ben-el-Keyss replied one day to some friends
who accused him of knowing nothing about either horses
or women:</p>

<p class='c008'><a id='Page_148'></a>REMARKS BY THE EMIR ABD-EL-KADER.</p>

<p class='c009'>To a King who asked a poet for his horse named
<i>Sakab</i>, the latter replied: "<i>Sakab</i> is not for sale, nor is
he to be exchanged. I would ransom him at the price of
my life. My family should die of hunger rather than
that he should suffer."</p>

<p class='c009'>An Arab once said: "My countrymen blame me for
being in debt, and yet I contracted it for a horse of noble
race and well rounded forms, who confers honour upon
them and serves as a talisman to my <i>goum</i>, and to whom
I have given a slave as his attendant."</p>

<p class='c009'>An Arab one day sent his son to buy a horse in the
market-place, and he, before setting out, asked his
father what qualities the animal should have. The
father made answer: "His ears should be ever in motion
turning sometimes forward, sometimes behind, as if he
were listening to something. His eyes ought to be
keen and restless, as if his mind were occupied with
something. His limbs must be well set on and well
proportioned." "Such a horse," the son rejoined, "will
never be sold by his master."</p>

<p class='c009'>Many of the Arabs of Upper Asia have genealogical
trees, in which they state and confirm by evidence that
would be accepted in a court of justice, the birth and
parentage of the colt, so that when a proprietor wishes to
<a id='Page_149'></a>sell a horse he has only to produce his genealogical tree
to satisfy the purchaser that he is not deceiving him.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have seen among the Annaza, a tribe extending
from Bagdad to the confines of Syria, horses so absolutely
priceless that it was impossible to buy them, or at
least to pay in cash for them. These horses are usually
disposed of to great personages or wealthy merchants,
who pay a fabulous price for them in thirty to fifty bills,
falling due at intervals of twelve months, or else they
bind themselves to pay an annual sum for ever to the
vendor and his descendants.</p>

<p class='c009'>"I take them by surprise in the morning, while the
bird is yet in its nest and the moisture from the dew is
making its way to the river.</p>

<p class='c009'>"I surprise them with my sleek-coated courser that by
its swiftness overtakes the wild beasts and never wearies
of hunting the gazelle in all seasons and far from our
home.</p>

<p class='c009'>"He has the flanks of the gazelle, the legs of the
female ostrich, and the straight back of the wild ass
standing as a sentinel on a hillock.</p>

<p class='c009'>"His croup, like to a heap of sand which moisture has
rendered compact, harmonizes with withers rising above
the back, like the pack-saddle of the camel kept in its
place by the crupper.</p>

<p class='c009'>"The swellings behind his ears are rounded like
spheres: the headstall and the headband seem as if they
were fixed to the extremity of the trunk of a palm-tree,
stripped of its leaves.</p>

<p class='c009'>"Fastened by the side of other horses, he bites and
demeans himself in his jealousy as if he were possessed
by a demon."</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <a id='Page_150'></a>
  <h2 class='c004'>SHOEING.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>Contrary to the accepted opinion, the Arabs of the
Sahara are in the custom of shoeing their horses, whether
on the two forefeet, or on all four feet, according to the
nature of the ground they occupy. Those who shoe
them on all four feet are the inhabitants of the stony
districts, and these constitute the majority. Among
them are the Arbâa, Mekhadema, Aghrazelia, Saâid-Mekhalif,
Oulad-Yagoub, Oulad-Nayl, Oulad-Sidi-Shikh,
Hamyane, etc., etc. It is the universal practice to take
the shoes off in the spring, when the animals are turned
out to grass; the Arabs asserting that care must be
taken not to check the renewal of the blood which takes
place at that season of the year.</p>

<p class='c009'>In every desert tribe there is a <i>douar</i> set apart by the
name of <i>douar-el-maâllemin</i>, "the master's douar." It is
that of the farriers. A profession entirely and especially
devoted to that indispensable complement of the Arab,
his horse, might be expected to be made the object of
particular esteem. Accordingly, numerous and invaluable
privileges are accorded to them, but I am not
certain if the concession of these privileges is to be
<a id='Page_151'></a>regarded as an homage rendered to an art that refers
exclusively to the horse, and not also, seeing that it is
the only art that survives in the desert, as a remembrance
of the encouragements formerly given to the able
and learned men of Arabia, Egypt, Africa, and Spain,
by the Arabs of the olden times, the brilliant conquerors
of the Goths and contemporaries of Haroun-al-Raschid.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Arabs of the Sahara say that their first farriers
came to them from the towns on the seaboard, such as
Fez, Tunis, Mascara, Tlemcen, and Constantine, since
when their knowledge and their calling have been
perpetuated in their families from generation to generation.
A farrier must likewise be something of an
armourer and iron-smith, to repair their bits, spurs,
knives, guns, sabres, and pistols, besides making horse-shoes,
sowing needles, sickles, small hatchets, and
mattocks.</p>

<p class='c009'>In return he enjoys the following immunities: He pays
no contributions—on the contrary, when his tribe
proceeds to the Tell to buy grain a collection is made
for his benefit. This immunity, however, he shares
with the maker of sandals. "The worker in iron and
the maker of boots pay no imposts." Neither is he called
upon to offer kouskoussou or shelter to any one: in
other words, he is exempted from the duty of hospitality,
which in certain cases is imposed upon all. The constant
toil demanded by his calling, the unavoidable
accidents to which he is liable through the urgent wants
of his brethren night and day, the sleepless nights he
has to undergo, entitle him to certain dues, called
<i>aâdet-el-maâllem</i>, "the master's dues." On their return
from the purchase of grain in the Tell every tent makes
<a id='Page_152'></a>over to him a <i>feutra</i> of wheat and barley, and a <i>feutra</i> of
butter. In the spring he receives in addition the fleece
of a ewe. If a camel is killed for eating, he claims the
part comprised between the withers and the tail, deducting
the hump, which, being covered with fat, is esteemed
a delicacy. In razzias and expeditions, whether or not
he has taken part in the enterprise, he is entitled to a
share of the booty. Usually, it is a sheep, or a camel,
according to the value of the prize. This due is known
as the horseman's ewe. The most important privilege,
however, accorded to farriers, the indisputable token of
the protection they formerly enjoyed and of the esteem
in which they are still held, is the gift of life on the field
of battle. If a farrier is on horseback, with arms in his
hands, he is liable to be killed like any other horseman
of the <i>goum</i>; but if he alights and kneels down and
imitates with the two corners of his burnous—raising
and depressing them by turns—the movement of his
bellows, his life will be spared. Many a horseman has
saved his life by means of this stratagem. A farrier can
only enjoy the benefit of this privilege by leading an
inoffensive life, absorbed in the duties of his business;
but if he distinguishes himself by his warlike prowess,
he forfeits the privileges of his calling, and is treated as
an ordinary horseman. These advantages, on the other
hand, are compensated by a serious drawback. Should
he happen to grow rich, a quarrel is fastened upon him
and in one way or another a portion of his wealth is taken
from him to prevent him from quitting the district.</p>

<p class='c009'>A farrier whose tribe has been plundered seeks out the
victors, and on the simple proof of his trade, recovers his
tent, tools, utensils, and horse-shoes. His implements
<a id='Page_153'></a>consist of a pair of bellows, which are nothing more
than a goat-skin bag with three openings, of which
two are on the upper part in the same line, and the third
at the opposite end. Through this last protrudes the
barrel of a gun, or pistol, that conveys the blast to the
fire. It is the wife's department to work the bellows.
She kneels down before the charcoal which is placed in
a hole, and takes in each hand one of the upper orifices,
which she closes by clutching the skin around
them. Then by alternately opening and closing her
hands, she produces a movement that causes a current
of air sufficient for the purpose, though not very powerful.
The Arabs of the Sahara give the preference over
a more perfect one to these bellows with their feeble
blast, but which are easily transported in their nomadic
expeditions. To the bellows the farrier joins an anvil,
a hammer, files, pincers, and a vice. These instruments
they obtain chiefly from the seabord, though some of
them they make for themselves. Formerly they used to
procure the iron in the great markets of the central
desert, at Tougourt, among the Beni-Mezabe, or at
Timimoun, according to the greater or less distance of
those points from their own neighbourhood; but now
they begin to purchase them from us. The charcoal
they prepare themselves with the <i>arar</i>, the <i>remt</i>, the
<i>senoubeur</i>, and the <i>djedary</i>, the last being the most
esteemed.</p>

<p class='c009'>The horse-shoes are kept ready made, and always
command a sure sale, the Arabs being in the habit of
laying in their supply for the whole year, consisting of
four sets for the fore-feet and four for the hind-feet. The
nails are likewise made by the farriers. When a horseman
<a id='Page_154'></a>goes to a farrier, taking his shoes with him, the
latter is paid by his privileges, and when the horse is
shod, its master gets on its back, merely saying: "Allah
have mercy on thy fathers!" He then goes his way and
the farrier returns to his work. But if the horseman
does not bring his shoes with him, he gives two <i>boudjous</i>
to the farrier for the complete set, and his thanks are
couched in the simplest formula of Arab courtesy. "Allah
give thee strength!" he says, as he takes his departure.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the Sahara, they put the shoes on cold. In the foot
of the horse, say the Arabs, there are hollow interstices,
such as the frog, the heel, etc., which it is always dangerous
to heat, if only by the approach of the hot iron.
This aversion for the hot iron, founded on the destructive
action of heat on the delicate parts of the foot, is so
strong among them that in bivouacs, when they see us
shoeing our horses, they exclaim: "Look at those
Christians pouring oil upon fire!" In a word, they cannot
understand why—especially in long marches, when
the exercise draws the blood down to the foot of the
horse—any one should wish to increase this natural
heat by the action of heated iron.</p>

<p class='c009'>The shoes are very light, of a soft, pliant metal. In
the fore-shoes only three nails are driven in on each side.
The toes are free, and never fastened. According to the
Arabs, nails in the toe would interfere with the elasticity
of the foot, and would cause the horse at the moment he
sets his foot on the ground precisely the same sensation
that a man experiences from wearing a tight shoe.
Many accidents thence ensue.</p>

<p class='c009'>The feet are neither pared nor shortened. The hoof is
allowed to grow freely, the very stony ground and incessant
<a id='Page_155'></a>work sufficing to wear it off naturally as it tries
to get beyond the iron. The necessity of paring the feet
is only felt when horses have been for a long time fastened
in front of the tent without doing any work, or
have remained long in the Tell. In such a case the
Arabs simply make use of the sharp-pointed knives which
they are never without. This method has this further
advantage that if a horse casts a shoe, he can still proceed
on his journey, as the sole remains firm and hard.
"With you," say they, "and with your practise of paring
the foot, if the horse casts a shoe you must pull up, or
see him bleeding, halting and suffering."</p>

<p class='c009'>The shoes are joined at the heel. As the horse can
only suffer in the part that is quick, and not in the
part that is hard, it is, of course, the frog that should
be shielded from accident. The shoes should therefore
follow the curvature of the frog. They give to the nail-heads
the form of a grasshopper's head, the only form,
as they allege, that allows the nails to be worn down to
the last without breaking. They approve of our method
of driving the nails into punched holes and clinching
them outside, which prevents a horse from cutting himself;
but their scarcity of iron obliges them to content
themselves, for their part, with hammering the nails
down upon the hoof, so as to render them serviceable a
second time by making a new head. If a horse overreaches
himself they cut away his heels and place light
shoes on his forefeet, but heavier ones on his hindfeet.
They are careful not to leave one foot shod and the other
bare. If during an excursion a horse happens to cast
one of his fore-shoes, and his rider has not a fresh supply
with him, he takes off both the hind shoes and puts one
<a id='Page_156'></a>of them on the forefoot; and if the animal is shod only
on his forefeet, the rider will take the shoe off the other
foot, rather than leave him in such a condition. Should
a horse, after a long journey such as the horsemen of
the desert not unfrequently make, require to be shod, it
is no uncommon thing to place a morsel of felt between
the shoe and the foot.</p>

<p class='c009'>The necessity, caused partly by the nature of the
ground and partly by the length of their excursions, of
shoeing the horses of the Sahara, has shown the expediency
of accustoming the colt to let himself be shod
without resistance. They therefore give him kouskoussou,
cakes, dates, etc., while he allows them to lift his
foot and knock upon it. They then caress his neck and
cheeks, and speak to him in a low tone; and thus after
a while he lifts his feet whenever they are touched. The
little difficulty experienced at a later period, thanks to
this early training, has probably given rise to the Arab
hyperbole: "So wonderful is the instinct of the thoroughbred
horse that if he casts a shoe he draws
attention to it himself by showing his foot." This
exaggeration at least proves how easy these horses are
to be shod, and further explains how every horseman in
the desert ought to have the knowledge and the means
of shoeing his own horse, while on a journey. It is a
point of the highest importance. It is not enough to be
very skilful in horsemanship, or to train a horse in the
most perfect manner, to acquire the reputation of a
thorough horseman—in addition to all this, he must
likewise be able to put on a shoe if necessary. Thus on
setting out for a distant expedition every horseman
carries with him in his <i>djebira</i> shoes, nails, a hammer,
<a id='Page_157'></a>pincers, some strips of leather to repair his harness, and
a needle. Should his horse cast a shoe, he alights,
unfastens his camel-rope, passes one end round the
<i>kerbouss</i> of the saddle and the other round the pastern,
and ties the two ends together at such a length as will
make the horse present his foot. The animal stirs not
an inch, and his rider shoes him without assistance. If
it be a hind shoe that has been thrown, he rests the foot
upon his knee, and dispenses with aid from his neighbours.
To avoid making a mistake he passes his awl
into the nail holes in order to assure himself beforehand
of the exact direction the nails should take. If, by
chance, the horse is restive, he obtains for the hindfeet
the help of a comrade who pinches the nose or ears of
the animal. For the forefeet, he merely turns his hindquarters
towards a thick prickly shrub, or extemporises
a torchenes with a nose-bag filled with earth. Such
cases, however, are rare.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Saharenes declare that our shoes are much too
heavy and in long and rapid excursions must be dreadfully
fatiguing to the articulations, and cause much
mischief to the fetlock joint. "Look at our horses,"
say they, "how they throw up the earth and sand behind
them! how nimble they are! how lightly they lift their
feet! how they extend or contract their muscles! They
would be as awkward and as clumsy as yours did we not
give them shoes light enough not to burden their feet,
and the materials of which as they grow thinner commingle
with the hoof and with it form one sole body."
And when I have answered that we did not discover in
our mode of shoeing the inconveniences pointed out by
them, they would reply: "How should you do so? Cover
<a id='Page_158'></a>as we do in a single day the distance you take five or
six days to accomplish, and then you will see. Grand
marches you make, you Christians, with your horses!
As far as from my nose to my ear!"</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <a id='Page_159'></a>
  <h2 class='c004'>HARNESS.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>I have stated that the Arab saddle furnishes the rider
with such a firm seat that he does not trouble himself at
all about certain vices in a horse that are apt to cause us
uneasiness. I will therefore say a few words on the
subject, though it is one now familiar to every body.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Arab saddle consists of a wooden saddle-tree,
surmounted in front by a long <i>kerbouss</i> or pommel, and
by a broad troussequin behind, high enough to protect
the loins. The whole is covered and held together,
without nails or pegs, by a plain camel's skin which
gives it great solidity. The bands rest on the animal's
back, and are broad and flat, with a proper regard for
the freedom of the withers and loins, and afford a roomy
and commodious seat. This last is very hard, and it
requires long practice to get used to it. The chiefs
cover it with a woollen cushion; but the common horsemen
make it a point of honour to ride on the bare wood,
pretending that the use of cushions is excessive effeminacy,
and by diminishing their points of contact cannot
fail to invite them to sleep during a long course, and
consequently expose them to injure their horses. This
<a id='Page_160'></a>is all the more meritorious that for the most part, and
especially in summer they ride without trousers or
drawers.</p>

<p class='c009'>The saddle-tree is concealed by a <i>stara</i>, or covering
of red morocco, without ornament, in the case of
individuals who are poor or not very well-to do; and by
a <i>ghrebaria</i>, or covering of cloth or scarlet velvet,
embroidered with gold or silver thread, and ornamented
with fringes, in the case of rich people and chiefs. The
<i>deïr</i>, or breast-piece, is very broad and is placed like
that of our French saddle. Its extremities are provided
with two strong buckles of iron or chased silver, and are
fastened to the saddle-tree by small girth-leathers, so
placed as to keep the saddle in its true position. The
Arabs will have nothing to do with a crupper. They
say it interferes with every forward movement by the
restraint it imposes on the animal. They use it only
with bat mules and donkeys, and even then they do not
pass it under the tail.</p>

<p class='c009'>The stirrups are broad and clumsy. Their lateral
faces gradually diminish so as to unite with the upper
bar which supports the ring for the stirrup-leathers.
They are used very short, and the whole foot is thrust
into them, and thus shielded from balls or falls. These
stirrups are extremely painful for those who are not
accustomed to them, because in raising oneself on them
the eye strikes against the bone of the leg. After a time
the skin hardens and an exostosis is formed that destroys
all sensibility. It is by these exostoses that a horseman
is distinguished from a foot-soldier, and so clearly, indeed,
that in the province of Oran a certain Bey, having
resolved to inflict an exemplary chastisement on a tribe
<a id='Page_161'></a>that had revolted, put to death all who fell into his hands,
bearing these marks. He well knew that his anger was
vented only on the horsemen. The stirrups of wealthy
individuals are either plated or gilt, and in former times
the great Turkish officers had them made of solid silver
or gold. The stirrups are suspended by leathers placed
behind the girth, which are simply twisted straps of
morocco or camel's skin—when doubled seven or eight
times, they are of great strength. The noble make their
stirrup-leathers of silken cord; but as these, let them be
ever so solid, will not suffice when going at a rapid pace
with the whole weight thrown upon the stirrups, they
add what are called <i>maoune</i>, or stirrup-holders.</p>

<p class='c009'>By way of horse-cloths the Arabs make use of pieces
of felt fastened to the saddle, to allow of the operation of
saddling being quickly performed. They are seven in
number, and dyed blue, red, and yellow—the blue
being uppermost. An eighth one is added, but white
and unattached, so that it can be washed and dried in
the sun if the horse has perspired much. When these
pieces of felt are well shaped, the different colours lying
one over the other and slightly projecting, form an
ornament in very fair taste, while they preserve the
horse from wounds and sores. Care is taken that they
should partially cover the loins.</p>

<p class='c009'>The saddle-girth is placed in front of the stirrups, and
is narrower than ours. The Arabs as a rule girth their
horses loosely; and they can do so without inconvenience,
as their saddles never slip round.</p>

<p class='c009'>The headstall of the bridle is very broad; blinkers are
used, and occasionally, but not often, a throat-band, loose
and fastened to the headband. The Arab of the Sahara,
<a id='Page_162'></a>however, does not approve of it, because if his horse, as
may often happen, should be seized by the bridle in a
fight, it deprives him of his usual resource of slipping the
bridle over the head, and so escaping from the enemy,
whose prize is thus reduced to the bridle alone. The
blinkers have the advantage of preventing a horse from
being disquieted by external objects, and are perhaps
partly the cause of his not fearing anything. The headstall
and the headband of the bridle are embroidered in
silk for the commonality, and in silver or gold for the rich.
The bit is attached to the bridle, and is never cleaned.
The bars are broad, short, straight, and fashioned <i>à la
Condé</i>. The canons are flat, and the curb is a circular
ring fixed to the upper part of the mouth piece. The
Arab bit allows no liberty to the tongue, and its lever-arm
is much shorter than in a French bit: consequently,
it is much less severe than has been hitherto imagined.
The advantage it offers in wartime of being free from
those curbs and hooks which are often so difficult to
replace, cannot be too highly appreciated.</p>

<p class='c009'>The reins are long. Two knots are made in them,
one at the length whence a horse can be kept at a foot
pace without impeding the freedom of his movements,
and the other at the point where experience has shown
that the horse, after shortening the muscles of the neck
for a gallop, begins to bear on the hand. They are held
very full, and at times used as a whip to quicken the
animal. The Arabs reject the snaffle as calculated to
confuse a horse. Rarely combatting with the sabre,
they have never experienced the necessity of it.</p>

<p class='c009'>As with them the horse is constantly fastened by
hobbles, the Arabs do not understand the value of the
<a id='Page_163'></a>halter which we employ. They replace it by a <i>goulada</i>,
a thick cord of silk or camel's hair, of a more or less
lively colour according to the coat of the animal. It is
passed round the neck, and from it are suspended small
morocco sachets, inclosing talismans that have the virtue
of preserving from the evil eye, of averting sickness,
and of bringing success in war. This <i>goulada</i> is, in the
first place, an ornament, and, besides, it serves to hold
the horse by, when required. To take him by the forelock
to hold or lead him, as we do, is to dishonour him;
for the Prophet has said: "The good things of this world
to the day of the last judgment shall be suspended from
the hairs that are between the eyes of your horses."</p>

<p class='c009'>The Arabs of the Sahara make use of a whip to correct
a horse when they are breaking him in, or to excite him
in war or at the chace. It is composed of five or six
twisted leather thongs, attached to a ring fixed to a bar
of iron six or seven inches long, terminating in another
ring. To the latter is fastened the small leather thong
that is slipped over the wrist. Round the iron rod, but
shorter by an inch, is a hollow cylinder, also of iron, of
a diameter that allows the rod to play easily within it.
The whip is used with all their might. It punishes so
severely that after a time it suffices to shake it in order
to make the animal dash forward at full speed—the noise
made by the cylinder coming in contact either with the
rings or with the bar that connects them, recalling to
his memory the nearly similar sound of the <i>tekerbeâa</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the desert the Arabs carry from the <i>kerbouss</i> of the
saddle a club a cubit in length, and terminating in a
large knob garnished with spikes. It is hung from the
wrist by a leather thong. Some replace this by a longer
<a id='Page_164'></a>club terminating in a hook, for the purpose of picking
up booty from off the ground, without alighting from
the saddle. The latter is called <i>el aâraya</i>, or the
despoiler. Neither the Arbâ nor the Harrars would ever
mount on horseback without one of these clubs.</p>

<p class='c009'>The spurs have only one spike, and are clumsy, solid,
and long. They are kept in their place by a simple
leather strap crossed, and are attached very loosely.</p>

<p class='c009'>Every Arab carries as a complement of his equipment,
suspended from the <i>kerbouss</i> of his saddle, a kind of
sabretache called <i>djebira</i> or <i>guerab</i>. It contains several
compartments, for the purpose of carrying bread, biscuit,
a mirror, soap, cartridges, shoes, a flint, writing materials,
etc., etc., according to the calling of the owner.
Some <i>djebiras</i> are extraordinary rich. I am convinced
that the sabretaches of our Hussars must have come to
us from the East. The common people on an expedition
carry also suspended from the troussequin of their saddle
a kind of wallet, which they call <i>semmâte</i>. They are
shorter than ours, so as not to irritate the animal's flanks.</p>

<p class='c009'>With the exception of the great chiefs, the Arabs have
no holsters to their saddles. They carry their pistols in
their girdles, or in a heart-shaped case that rests on the
left side, and is held in its place by a leather strap over
the shoulder and another round the body. They prefer
this latter mode, because they are sure of having them
on their person if they chance to be separated from their
horse.</p>

<p class='c009'>Those who do not put a throat-band to their bridle
generally adorn their horses with boar's tusks or lion's
teeth, or with talismans which they attach to their necks
by means of silk or woollen cords.</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='Page_165'></a>To our taste, the less covered a thoroughbred horse
may be, the better are the beauty and elegance of his
form displayed. The Arabs think differently. They
say:</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>During my residence in Africa, I have seen so many
horses that it was impossible to dispose of when girt
with an English saddle, bought up with avidity when
caparisoned with an Arab one, that I am much inclined
to adopt the native prejudice. Many a time also I have
observed that when an Arab, who had purchased a horse
from an European, had covered its back with his own
saddle, the vendor was seized with regret, being struck
with a beauty he had never before noticed. It is true,
the only extravagance indulged in by the Arabs is in
their harness; for the Prophet, while proscribing the use
of gold in their garments, authorised and even enjoined
it, in respect of arms and horses. He said: "Whoso
fears not to spend money on the maintenance of horses
for the holy war, shall be considered, after his death, as
the equal of him who has always been open-handed."
It is therefore no uncommon sight to see, even in these
times of trouble and misery, an Arab chief treat himself
to a saddle worth from £80 to £120, and on days of
feasting or on solemn occasions, cover the croup of his
horse with <i>shelil</i>, a silken stuff of brilliant hues.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>MAXIMS OF THE ARAB CAVALIER.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>When thou mountest a horse, first pronounce these
words: <i>Bi es-sem Allah</i>, "in the name of Allah." The
grave of the horseman is always open.</p>

<p class='c009'>The cavalier of Truth should eat little, and, above all,
drink little. If he cannot endure thirst, he will never
make a warrior—he is nothing but a frog of the
marshes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Purchase a good horse. If thou pursuest, thou attainest:
if thou art pursued, the eye presently knoweth not
where thou hast passed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Prefer a horse from the mountain to a horse from the
plain, and the latter to one from the marshland, which
is only fit to carry the pack-saddle.</p>

<p class='c009'>For the combat mount a horse with a trailing tail
[that is, one at least eight years old]. In the day when
the horsemen shall be so crowded together that the
stirrups knock against one another, he will save thee
from the thick of the fight and bear thee back to thy
tent, though he were pierced by a ball.</p>

<p class='c009'>When thou hast purchased a horse, study him carefully,
and give him barley more and more every day
<a id='Page_167'></a>until thou hast ascertained the quantity demanded by
his appetite. A good horseman ought to know the
measure of barley suited to his horse, as exactly as the
measure of powder suited to his gun.</p>

<p class='c009'>Suffer neither dogs nor donkeys to lie down upon the
straw or barley you intend to give to your horses.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Prophet has said: "Every grain of barley given
to your horses shall secure you an indulgence in the
other world."</p>

<p class='c009'>Give barley to your horses; deprive yourself to give
them still more; for Sidi-Hamed-ben-Youssouf has remarked;
"Had I not seen the mare produce the foal, I
should have said it was the barley." He has also said:
"Superior to spurs there is nothing but barley."</p>

<p class='c009'>Do not water your horses more than once a day, at
one or two in the afternoon; and give barley only in the
evening, at sunset. It is a good practice in wartime,
and, besides, it is the way to make their flesh firm and
hard.</p>

<p class='c009'>To train a horse that is too fat for the fatigues of war,
reduce him by exercise, but never by lowering his keep.</p>

<p class='c009'>So long as your horse, when at work, sweats over his
whole body, you may say that he is not in good wind.
But you may count upon him as soon as he sweats only
on the ears and chest.</p>

<p class='c009'>Leave not thy horse near others that are eating barley,
without he has some likewise, for otherwise he will
fall ill.</p>

<p class='c009'>Never water your horse after having given him barley.
It would be the death of the animal.</p>

<p class='c009'>Never give water to a horse after a rapid gallop, for
here is danger of checked perspiration.</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='Page_168'></a>After a rapid gallop, water him with the bridle on, and
feed him with the saddle-girth on, and thou wilt not
repent of it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Be clean, and perform your ablutions before mounting
your horse, and the Prophet will love you.</p>

<p class='c009'>Whoso is guilty of an impropriety on the back of his
horse is not worthy to own him. Moreover, he will
suffer for it, for his horse will do himself a hurt.</p>

<p class='c009'>Never fall asleep upon thy horse. The sleep of the
rider wounds or wearies the animal.</p>

<p class='c009'>When you put a horse to his speed, husband his
strength for the time of need. He must be treated like
a goat-skin water-bag, which if you open gradually,
keeping the neck nearly closed, you will easily preserve
the water. But if you open it hastily, the water will rush
out all at once, and not a drop will remain to quench
your thirst.</p>

<p class='c009'>A horseman should never urge his horse to full speed,
while going up or down hill, unless he is forced to do
so. He ought, on the contrary, to hold him in.</p>

<p class='c009'>"Which dost thou prefer?" the horse was asked one day,
"The getting on, or the getting off thy back?" And he
made answer: "Allah curse the point where they meet!"</p>

<p class='c009'>When you have a long journey to accomplish, relieve
your horse by changing his pace, to enable him to
recover his wind. Repeat this until he has sweated and
dried three times, then shift his girth, and afterwards do
what you will with him. He will never fail you in a
difficulty.</p>

<p class='c009'>If, on a march, you have a strong wind right in your
teeth, contrive if possible to save your horse from facing
it—you will spare him various diseases.</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='Page_169'></a>If at the bivouac your horse is so placed that he
cannot move out of the wind that is blowing violently
into his nostrils, do not hesitate to leave the nose-bag
suspended from his nose—you will preserve him from
serious mischief.</p>

<p class='c009'>If you have put your horse to the gallop and other
mounted men are following behind, soothe him, do not
urge him on, for he will be sufficiently excited of himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>If you are chasing an enemy and he commits the
error of pushing his horse on, hold in your own—you
are sure to overtake the fugitive.</p>

<p class='c009'>Never strike a thoroughbred. It humiliates him, and
his pride will revolt and urge him to resistance. It is
quite sufficient to correct or animate him by word or
gesture.</p>

<p class='c009'>If, after having wandered a long time in the mountains
and by narrow path-ways, the horseman descends into
the plain, it is good to give the animal a gallop over
a short distance.</p>

<p class='c009'>At starting the rider should not scruple to play with
his horse for a few minutes, as he will thereby relax his
joints, and assure himself peace for the rest of the day.
In like manner, after a painful and fatiguing excursion,
at the moment he reaches his tent let him perform the
fantasia for a while. The women of the <i>douar</i> will
applaud, saying: "Look at so-and-so, son of so-and-so!"
and he will find out, besides, what his horse is really
worth.</p>

<p class='c009'>The rider who does not teach his horse a good pace is
no true horseman, but an object of pity.</p>

<p class='c009'>If, in war time or in hunting, your horse is in a lather,
and you happen to come across a stream, have no fear
<a id='Page_170'></a>of allowing him to swallow half a dozen mouthfuls with
the bridle on. So far from doing him any harm it will
enable him to continue his course.</p>

<p class='c009'>When you dismount think of your horse before thinking
of yourself. It is he who has carried you, and is to
carry you again.</p>

<p class='c009'>After a long journey, either unsaddle your horse
immediately and throw cold water over his back, at the
same time leading him up and down; or else leave the
saddle on until he is perfectly dry and has eaten his
barley. There is no middle path between these two
courses.</p>

<p class='c009'>When after a long journey in winter, through rain
and cold, you at length regain your tent, cover your
horse well, and give him parched barley and warmed
milk, but do not let him have any water that day.</p>

<p class='c009'>Suffer not your horse to have anything to eat or drink
directly after a journey of unusual length, or you will
produce inflammation.</p>

<p class='c009'>Put not your horses to speed, unless positively
compelled to do so, during the great heats of summer.
The animal himself says:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>Put me not to speed in the summer,</div>
    <div>If thou would'st that I should one day save thee from the sabre.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>In a case of life or death if you feel your horse's
wind failing, take off the bridle if only for an instant,
and strike him on the croup with a spur sharply enough
to draw blood.</p>

<p class='c009'>If after a rapid gallop you are able to give a little respite
to your horse, you will know when to start again by
the drying up of the mucus that issues from his nostrils.</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='Page_171'></a>If you would know, at the end of a day of excessive
fatigue and hard riding, how far you can yet depend
upon your horse, get off his back and pull him strongly
towards you by the tail. If he remains unmoved as if
rooted to the ground, you may still rely upon him.</p>

<p class='c009'>On an expedition when, after great fatigue, you have
only a moment for repose, take for your pillow some of
the bridles of your brethren, and you will not be abandoned
or forgotten, happen what may.</p>

<p class='c009'>A horseman ought to study the habits of his horse and
obtain a thorough knowledge of his character. He will
then know whether, when he alights, he can have any
confidence in him and can leave him in the midst of
other animals, or whether he must keep an eye upon
him and hobble him. Not one of these details is a matter
of indifference in the presence of an enemy.</p>

<p class='c009'>The proper season for calling on a horse to do great
things, is the spring, before the great heats; or the
autumn, before the intense cold.</p>

<p class='c009'>The horse is what his work is.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>Yes, give the heel to your steeds,</div>
    <div>Learn and teach them what will be of service to you.</div>
    <div>In this world it is certain that, one day or another,</div>
    <div>Every man has to face him who demands his life.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>REMARKS BY THE EMIR ABD-EL-KADER.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Arabs have preserved the practice of racing their
horses against one another, in which they indulged so
far back as in the times of idolatry, prior to Mohammed.
<a id='Page_172'></a>The new law has in no way altered this usage. On
the contrary it has consecrated its lawfulness, and, by
impressing it with the seal of religion, has attached
additional importance to it.</p>

<p class='c009'>For racing, the Arabs subject their horses to a preparatory
regimen, which is called <i>tadmir</i>, or training.
Thank to this treatment, a horse acquires a wonderful
speed. The <i>tadmir</i> is in this wise.</p>

<p class='c009'>They begin by increasing the animal's allowance of
food, so that he gains fat to a perceptible degree. When
this result has been attained, they begin to reduce his
condition by gradually diminishing his rations for forty
days, until they have reached the minimum of nourishment.
During these forty days, they subject him to
progressive exercise. At the same time, and from the
very first day from lowering his keep, they cover the
animal with seven <i>djellale</i>, or horse-cloths, one of which
they remove every six days. The sweating disperses all
the fat, gets rid of a useless weight, gives tone to the
muscles, and leaves nothing but hard flesh. By means
of this treatment, a horse attains, according to the stock
he comes from, the highest degree of speed. Thus
prepared, the horse is brought on to the <i>djalba</i> or race
ground.</p>

<p class='c009'>Horses arriving from all districts are led on to the
<i>djalba</i>, and crowds of people likewise flock thither. At
no other time, except at the period of the assemblage of
pilgrims, is such a concourse of men to be seen, and all
the nobles and chiefs are present.</p>

<p class='c009'>"We have taken part in the races, and, although it
was yet early, the crowd was as great as at the period
of pilgrimages."</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='Page_173'></a>Horses properly trained are never suffered to run
against those that are not. They are placed in different
classes, to each of which a different goal is assigned.
The trained horses have much the longest course to run.
The race-course in this case in called <i>el midmar</i>, and
upon this the learned Bokhari has remarked:</p>

<p class='c009'>"The Prophet caused the trained horses to run by
themselves, and fixed a distance of seven miles to
traverse, while for ordinary horses he fixed a distance of
only three miles."<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c011'><sup>[52]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>The horses are grouped together by tens, but before
allowing them to start and to prevent false starts, the
following precaution is taken. A rope is stretched
across touching the animals' chests, the two ends of
which are held by two men. This rope is called <i>el
mikbad</i>, and <i>el mikouas</i>; and in reference to it the
Prophet said: "The horse runs according to his race,
but placed before the <i>mikouas</i> he runs according to his
chance of a rider." Or, in other words: "In ordinary
circumstances the speed of horses depends on the qualities
of blood with which they are more or less endowed; but
in a race success depends greatly on the skill of the rider,
and not unfrequently a horse of the purest blood may be
outstripped by a less noble animal." To each of the ten
horses that have contended, a name is assigned indicative
of his degree of swiftness. Thus the one that arrives
first at the goal is called <i>Modjalla</i>, "taking away,"
because he takes away care from the heart of his master.
The second is named <i>el Mousalli</i>, from the word <i>salouan</i>,
"the extremity of the buttocks," because he follows the
first so closely that the point of his nose touches the
<a id='Page_174'></a>other's hindquarters. "I must positively be the <i>mousalli</i>,
[that is, the second] if I consent to thy carrying off the
first prize." The third receives the surname of <i>el Msali</i>,
"Consoling," because he consoles his master, who is
content that there is only one horse between his own
and the winner. The fourth is <i>el Tali</i>, or "the Follower;"
the fifth <i>el Mourtah</i>, "the fifth finger of the hand;" the
sixth <i>el Aâtif</i>; the seventh <i>el Hadi</i>, "the Lucky one,"
because he has his share of success with the foremost;
the eighth, <i>el Mouhammil</i>, "one who gives hopes,"
because he caused his master to hope that he might be
among the winners; the ninth, <i>el Lathim</i>, or "the Buffeted,"
because he has been humiliated and rejected on
all sides; and the tenth, <i>el Sokeït</i>, "the Taciturn,"
because his master undergoes the lowest humiliation
without uttering a word—shame closing his mouth. Of
these ten horses seven gain a prize, but the others
obtain nothing. At the further end of the course a vast
tent is pitched, into which the seven winners are admitted
in order to shelter them, while the three others are
ignominiously driven away.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c000'>
    <div>IN THE NAME OF ALLAH THE CLEMENT AND MERCIFUL.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>"We took part in the horse races. Though it was early
morning the crowd was as dense as at the season of pilgrimage.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Horses were brought from every quarter, but no one knows
better than ourselves how to rear and train them.</p>

<p class='c010'>"We arrived at the peep of day with horses whose hoofs were
as hollow as cups. The stars had announced good fortune to
them.</p>

<p class='c010'>"They are drawn up according to the purity of their race.
The noble is placed by the side of the noble.</p>

<p class='c010'><a id='Page_175'></a>"Among them is a black horse with robust limbs and adorned
with a white mark on his forehead. When he feels the bit in his
mouth, he dashes off, clearing the lines traced to indicate the
goal.</p>

<p class='c010'>"The star that shines on his forehead equals the brilliancy of
Mirzam.<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c011'><sup>[53]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>"Then a dark bay with a black mane, endowed by nature
with admirable qualities, with a sleek skin, bearing also a star
on his forehead, and a white mark on the upper lip.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Next a horse completely black without a white spot anywhere,
but participating in the excellent qualities of the preceding.</p>

<p class='c010'>"They have been brought to excite the admiration of the
spectators, impatient to see them appear in the lists.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Horsemen mount them, hardy as bars of iron and short of
stature. Their voice is like the roaring of the lion.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Seated on their coursers they look like starlings hovering
over the table-land of a mountain.</p>

<p class='c010'>"At last they draw up in line. In the midst of the assembly
of spectators, a man, a Mussulman like the others, sits in the
capacity of umpire. He has been chosen by common accord as
arbiter, and surely his awards will not be tainted with partiality.</p>

<p class='c010'>"The steeds let loose in the arena disperse immediately like
pearls that fall from a necklace, or like a covey of <i>ketâa</i> (gray
partridges) discovered by a falcon that swoops down upon them,
attacking them with fury.</p>

<p class='c010'>"The black, with a white mark on the forehead, comes in first.</p>

<p class='c010'>"The bay with the dark mane is second, and the entirely black
is without reproach, for he runs in third.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Tali</i> is the fourth, and follows the others. But how far is
the inhabitant of the Tahama from the inhabitant of Nedjed!</p>

<p class='c010'>The fifth, <i>el Mourtah</i>, is not to be blamed, for he has done as
well as he could do.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Aâtif</i> is the sixth. He comes in all trembling, and his fear
well nigh stopped him in mid-career.</p>

<p class='c010'>"The seventh is the <i>Hadi</i>. The awarder of prizes will give
unto him his due.</p>

<p class='c010'>"The <i>Mouhammil</i>, who gave such hopes to his master, has
<a id='Page_176'></a>come in the eighth. He was mistaken. The unfortunate one
encountered on his path the bird of ill omen. He suffered seven
horses to pass before him and ran in the eighth—but the eighth
horse is not one of the winners.</p>

<p class='c010'>"The ninth arrives at last. He is the <i>Lathim</i>, the buffeted one,
and receives blows from every one.</p>

<p class='c010'>"On his traces follows, capering about, the <i>Sokeït</i>, the Silent
one, with trouble in his face and humiliation on his forehead.
The horseman who rides him at the tail of the others is the object
of reproaches from all sides, and still more so his groom. It is of
little use to ask who is his master,—no answer is to be had from
those whom shame has made dumb.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Whoso does not take to the race-course the horses that are
most noble by birth ought to repent of it.</p>

<p class='c010'>"In being present we have experienced the greatest gratification,
without speaking of the glory and advantages we have
carried off.</p>

<p class='c010'>"In exchange for the seven reeds planted at the end of the
course and carried off by the first seven as they arrived, we have
received magnificent presents, such as it is seemly to offer.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Striped calico from Yemen, dyed of various colours, and <i>haïks</i>
of silk and of wool.</p>

<p class='c010'>"We carried off all these stuffs spread out over our horses,
with borders red as blood.</p>

<p class='c010'>"In addition to all this they gave us silver coins by thousands,
but this silver we never keep for ourselves. We distribute it
among the servants who tend our horses, though we ourselves
tend these with our own hands far more carefully than they do.</p>

<p class='c010'>"These are horses that never drink any but the purest water,
and never feed on any but the choicest food.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c009'>The Mussulman law distinguishes three ways of offering
prizes for horse racing. The first is positively permitted,
the second is so conditionally, and the third is
utterly prohibited. In the first case, some one entirely
without interest in the result of the race offers a prize,
saying: "Whoever shall be victor in the race shall gain
<a id='Page_177'></a>the prize." Kings, chiefs, and great personages whose
rank or fortune places them in an exalted position, sometimes
propose prizes in this manner, which is sanctioned
without any condition. In the second case, an individual
interested in the race, says: "I offer a prize which shall
be given to the one first in." This mode is allowed,
with the condition that if the donor himself is the first
to arrive at the goal, the prize shall be given to the
assembly. The third manner is that by which every one
interested in the race offers a prize for the benefit of him
by whom he is beaten. This style of racing is nothing
more than a wager, and consequently is absolutely forbidden.
Much more is betting by persons not concerned
in the race formally prohibited.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>ABD-EL-KADER ON THE ARAB HORSE.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>Having known the Emir Abd-el-Kader during the
time I held the office of French Consul at Mascara, from
1837 to 1839, and having again met him at Toulon
in 1847, whither I had been ordered on special duty at
the time of his first landing in France, I had full opportunity
in my numerous interviews with him to appreciate
his intimate acquaintance with all that related to the
history of his country, as well as to all questions of
horse-flesh. I did not hesitate, therefore, to ask his
opinion on a subject of a purely scientific nature, which
may nevertheless be of great moment, not only for the
future interests of our colony, but for those of the country
at large. The following is his reply, written under date
of the 8th November, 1851.</p>

<p class='c010'>Glory to the one God, whose reign alone endureth for ever!</p>

<p class='c010'>Peace be with him who equals in good qualities all the men of
his time, who aims only at what is good, whose heart is pure
and his word abiding, the wise, the intelligent, the Lord General
Daumas, on the part of your friend Sid-el-Hadj Abd-el-Kader, son
of Mahhi-Eddin.</p>

<p class='c010'>Behold the reply to your inquiries:—</p>

<p class='c010'>1st. You ask me how many days an Arab horse can march
<a id='Page_179'></a>without rest and without suffering too severely. Know, then,
that a horse sound in every limb, that eats as much barley as his
stomach can contain, can do whatever his rider can ask of him.
For this reason the Arabs say: "Give barley and over-work him."
But without tasking him overmuch, a horse can be made to do
sixteen parasangs day after day.<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c011'><sup>[54]</sup></a> It is the distance from Mascara
to Koudiat-Aghelizan on the Oued-Mina; it has been measured
in cubits. A horse performing this journey every day, and
having as much barley as it likes to eat, can go on, without
fatigue, for three or four months, without lying by a single day.</p>

<p class='c010'>2nd. You ask me what distance a horse can accomplish in a day.
I cannot tell you very precisely, but it ought to be about fifty
parasangs, or the distance from Tlemcen to Mascara. However,
an animal that has performed such a journey ought to be carefully
ridden on the following day, and allowed to do only a very
much shorter distance. Most of our horses used to go from Oran
to Mascara in a single day, and could repeat the journey for
two or three consecutive days. On one occasion we started from
Saïda about eight in the morning to fall upon the Arbâa, who
were encamped at Aaïn-Toukria, among the Oulad-Aïad near
Taza, and we came up with them at break of day.</p>

<p class='c010'>3rd. You ask for examples of the temperance of the Arab horse,
and for proofs of his power of enduring hunger and thirst.
Know that when we were established at the mouth of the
Melouïa, we used to make razzias into the Djebel-Amour, following
the route of the Sahara, and on the day of attack pushing
forward at the gallop for five or six hours at a stretch—the
entire expedition, going and returning, being completed in
twenty to twenty-five days at the outside. During this space of
time our horses had no barley except what they carried with
them, about enough for eight ordinary feeds. Nor did they find
straw, or anything except the <i>alfa</i> and <i>shiehh</i>, and grass in the
spring time. And yet, on rejoining our people, we performed
the fantasia on our horses, and some among us burnt powder.
Many, too, who were not fresh enough for the latter exercise,
were quite able to go upon an expedition. Our horses would go
a day or two without water, and once they found none for three
days. The horses of the Sahara do far more than that, for they
go three months without touching a grain of barley. Straw
<a id='Page_180'></a>they meet with only when they go to the Tell to buy grain, and
for the most part feed on the <i>alfa</i>, the <i>shiehh</i>, and sometimes the
<i>guetof</i>. The <i>shiehh</i> is better than the <i>alfa</i>, but not so good
as the <i>guetof</i>. The Arabs say:</p>

      <div class='line'>The <i>alfa</i> is good for marching,</div>
      <div class='line'>The <i>shiehh</i> is good for fighting,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the <i>guetof</i> is superior to barley.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>In certain years the horses of the Sahara have gone the whole
twelve months without a grain of barley to eat, especially when
the tribes have not been suffered to enter the Tell. At such
times the Arabs give dates to their horses, which is a fattening
food, and keeps them in condition for marching or fighting.</p>

<p class='c010'>4th. You ask why, seeing the French do not mount their
horses before they are four years old, the Arabs mount theirs at
a very early age. Know that the Arabs say that horses, like
men, are more easily taught when quite young. They have a
proverb:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The lessons of infancy are engraved upon stone,</div>
      <div class='line'>The lessons of ripe age pass away like birds' nests.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>They likewise say:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c017'>
    <div>The young branch is made straight without much trouble,</div>
    <div>But the old wood can never be straightened.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>In the very first year, the Arabs teach the colt to let itself be
led by the <i>reseum</i>, a species of cavesson. They call it then <i>djeda</i>,
and begin to fasten and bridle it. As soon as it has become
<i>teni</i>, that is, as soon as it has entered on its second year, they
ride it a mile or two, or even a parasang, and after it has completed
eighteen months they do not fear to fatigue it. When it
has become <i>rebâa telata</i>, that is, when it has entered on its third
year, they tie it up, cease to ride it, cover it with a good <i>djellal</i>,
and get it into condition. They say:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>In his first year, tie him up lest he should meet with an accident;</div>
      <div class='line'>In his second year, ride him until his back bends;</div>
      <div class='line'>In his third year, again tie him up, and after that, if he does not</div>
      <div class='line in4'>suit you, sell him.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>If a horse is not ridden before his third year, it is certain that
he will never be good for anything but to gallop, which he does
<a id='Page_181'></a>not need to learn, as it is his nature to do so: an idea thus
expressed by the Arabs: "The noble horse gallops according to
his race"—that is, a thoroughbred horse has no occasion to be
taught to gallop.</p>

<p class='c010'>5th. You ask me how it is, seeing that the foal derives more
qualities from its sire than from its dam, that mares are always
higher priced than horses. The reason is this. He who buys a
mare does so with the expectation that he will not only be able
to make use of her for the saddle, but will also obtain from her
a numerous stock; while he who buys a horse cannot hope to
get any other advantage out of him than by riding him.</p>

<p class='c010'>6th. You ask me if the Arabs of the Sahara keep registers to
establish the descent of their horses. Know that the inhabitants
of the Algerian Sahara do not, any more than those of the Tell,
concern themselves with these registers. The notoriety of the
fact suffices them; for pedigree of their blood horses is as well
known to every one as that of their masters. I have heard it
said that some families possessed these written genealogies, but
I cannot answer for the fact. Such books, however, are kept in
the East.</p>

<p class='c010'>7th. You ask me which are the tribes of Algeria the most
renowned for the pure breed of their horses. Know that the best
horses of the Sahara are unquestionably those of Hamyân. They
possess none but excellent animals, because they never employ
them to till the ground, or as beasts of burden. They employ
them solely on expeditions and in battle. These are superior to
all others in endurance of hunger, thirst, and fatigue. Next in
order come the horses of the Harar, the Arbâa, and the Oulad-Naïl.
In the Tell, the horses in the first rank for nobility of race,
for height and beauty of mould, are those of the Shelif, especially
those of the Oulad-Sidi-Ben-Abd-Allah, near the Mina, and those
of the Oulad-Sidi-Hassan, a section of the Oulad-Sidi-Dahhou,
who dwell in the highlands of Mascara. The fleetest in the
race-course, and at the same time of a beautiful shape, are those
of the Flittas, the Oulad-Sherif, and the Oulad-Lekreud. The
best for traversing stony ground, without being shod, are those
of the Hassasna in the Yakoubia. The following words are
ascribed to Mulay-Ishmael, the celebrated Sultan of Morocco.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c017'>
    <div>May my horse have been reared in the Mâz,</div>
    <div>And watered in the Biaz.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'><a id='Page_182'></a>The Mâz is a district of the Hassasna, and the Biaz is the stream
known by the name of Foufet, that flows through their territory.
The horses of the Oulad-Khaled are also famous for the same
qualities. In reference to this tribe Sidi-Ahmed-Ben-Youssel has
said: "The long locks and the long <i>djellals</i> will lie seen in the
midst of you to the day of the resurrection," thus eulogising
their women and their horses.</p>

<p class='c010'>8th. You say that people maintain against you that the horses
of Algeria are not Arabs but Barbs. It is a theory that turns
against its own authors, for the Barbs were originally Arabs. A
well-known writer has said: "The Berbers inhabit the Mogheb.
They are all sons of Kaïs-Ben-Ghilan. It is likewise stated that
they spring from two great Hemiarite tribes, the Senahdja and
the Kettama, who came into the country at the time of the invasion
of Ifrikesh El Malik." According to both these opinions,
the Berbers are decidedly Arabs. Historians, moreover, establish
the descent of most of the Berber tribes from the Senahdja and
the Kettama. The arrival of these tribes was anterior to Islam.
Since the Mussulman invasion the number of Arabs who have
emigrated into the Mogheb is beyond computation. When the
Obeïdin [the Fatimites] were masters of Egypt, immense tribes
passed into Africa, among others the Riahh, and spread themselves
from Kaïrouan to Merrakesh [Morocco]. It is from these tribes
that are descended the Algerian tribes of the Douaouda, the
Aïad, the Mâdid, the Oulad-Mahdi, the Oulad-Iakoub-Zerara, the
Djendel, the Attaf, the Hamïs, the Braze, the Sbeha, the Flittas,
the Medjahar, the Mehal, the Beni-Aâmer, the Hamian, and many
more. Without doubt the Arab horses were dispersed through
the Mogheb in like manner with the Arab families. At the time
of Ifrikesh-ben-Kaïf, the empire of the Arabs was all powerful.
It extended as far west as the confines of the Mogheb, just as in
the time of Shamar the Hemiarite it extended eastward to the
frontiers of China, as it is related by Ben-Kouteïba in his book
entitled "El Marif."</p>

<p class='c010'>It is quite true, however, that although the Algerian horses
come of Arab stock, many have degenerated from their nobleness
from being employed much too often in the plough, in
carrying and drawing heavy loads, and in other kinds of labour,
and from other causes which did not exist among the Arabs
of the olden times. It is sufficient, they say, for a horse to have
walked over ploughed land to lose something of his excellence,
<a id='Page_183'></a>and by way of illustration they relate the following anecdote:</p>

<p class='c010'>"A man was riding one day, mounted on a thoroughbred,
when he met his enemy also mounted on a noble courser. The
one turned and fled, while the other gave chace. The latter was
distanced, and despairing to overtake the former, cried out to
him:</p>

<p class='c010'>"I demand of thee in the name of Allah, has thy horse ever
been in the plough?"</p>

<p class='c010'>"He has ploughed for four days."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Ah! mine has never been in the plough. By the head of the
Prophet, I am certain to overtake thee."</p>

<p class='c010'>"He then followed up the pursuit and towards the end of the
day the pursued began to lose ground and the pursuer to gain
upon him. At last the latter succeeded in coming up with and
combating him whom he had at first despaired of overtaking."</p>

<p class='c010'>"My father—Allah be merciful to him!—was in the habit of
saying: 'There was no blessing for our land since we converted
our coursers into beasts of burden and tillage. Did not Allah
create the horse for riding, the ox for the plough, and the camel
for the transport of burdens? There is nothing to be gained by
changing the ways of Allah.'"</p>

<p class='c010'>9th. You ask me further what is our practice with regard to
the keep and maintenance of our horses. Know that the master
of a horse gives him very little barley to begin with, and goes
on increasing the quantity little by little, until he fails to consume
it all, when the quantity is reduced and afterwards maintained
at the exact measure of his appetite. The best time of
day for giving barley is the evening. Unless on a journey, it is
useless to give it in the morning. The best way is to give it to
the horse saddled and girthed, just as the best way of watering
him is with the bridle on. There is a saying.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Water with the bridle,</div>
      <div class='line'>And barley with the saddle.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The Arabs greatly prefer a horse that eats little, provided he
does not lose strength. Such a one, say they, is a priceless treasure.
To water a horse at sunrise, makes him lose flesh. To
water him in the evening, puts him into good condition. To water
him in the middle of the day, keeps him as he is. During
the great heats which last for forty days, the Arabs water their
horses only every second day: a custom, they assert, attended
<a id='Page_184'></a>with beneficial effects. In summer, autumn, and winter they
throw an armful of straw to their horses; but the substance of
their keep is barley, in preference to every other kind of food.
They say: "Had we not seen that horses come from horses, we
should have said that it is the barley that produces them."
Again:</p>

<p class='c010'>"Of forbidden flesh, choose the lightest," that is, choose a
horse that is light and nimble—horse-flesh being forbidden to
Mussulmans.</p>

<p class='c010'>"No one becomes a horseman until he has been often thrown."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Thoroughbred horses have no vice."</p>

<p class='c010'>"A horse in a leading-string is an honour to his master."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Horses are birds without wings."</p>

<p class='c010'>"No distance is far for a horse."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Whoso forgets the beauty of horses for that of women will
never prosper."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Horses know their riders."</p>

<p class='c010'>The pious Ben-el-Abbas—Allah be good to him!—hath said:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c017'>

  <h2 class='c004'>THE EMIR ABD-EL-KADER ON THE HORSE.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>It is certain that the Arabs are the most experienced
horsemen in the world. They know a horse thoroughly
and minutely, and can rear and train one better than
any other people. It is also certain that the Arab horses
are better than those of all other nations. A sufficient
proof of this is that they always finish by overtaking the
gazelle, the ostrich, and the wild ass, which they sometimes
pursue to a great distance.</p>

<p class='c009'>"He has chased the onager, the buffalo, and the
ostrich, without once pulling up, and without a single
drop of sweat moistening his coat."</p>

<p class='c009'>The nature of the horses of the Sahara is a consequence
of the life led by their masters. The Saharenes
are obliged to accustom their horses to support hunger
through the scarcity of food, and likewise thirst through
the scarcity of water, which is frequently not to be found
within a couple of day's march of the encampment.
Endurance of fatigue and speed are the result of the
countless quarrels of these Arabs, their incessant hostile
excursions, and their fondness for the chace of the swiftest
animals, such as the ostrich, the gazelle, and the
<a id='Page_190'></a>wild ass, which some among them hunt the whole year
round without interruption.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Most High hath said: "Put on foot all the forces
you can dispose of, and hold in readiness a large number
of horses, to intimidate the enemies of Allah and your
own, and yet others, whom you know not but who are
known to Allah. Whatever you shall have expended in
the service of Allah, shall be recompensed to you. You
will not be forsaken."</p>

<p class='c009'>And the Prophet never ceased to repeat:</p>

<p class='c009'>"Whoso possesses an Arab horse and honours him,
will be honoured of Allah."</p>

<p class='c009'>"Whoso possesses an Arab horse and contemns him,

  <a id='Page_196'></a>
  <h2 class='c004'>THE RAZZIA.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>The most frequent and almost daily incident of Arab
life is the <i>razzia</i>. Glory is a fine ting, no doubt, and in
the Sahara hearts are as open to its fascination as
elsewhere. But there, the idea of glory is to injure the
enemy and destroy his resources, and at the same time
augment one's own. Glory is not smoke, but plunder.
The thirst for revenge is also a motive; but what vengeance
is sweeter than to enrich oneself with the spoils
of one's enemy? This threefold craving for glory,
revenge, and plunder, could not possibly be gratified
more promptly or efficaciously than by the <i>razzia</i>—the
invasion by force or stratagem of the ground occupied
by the foe, which contains all that is dear to him, his
family and his fortune.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the desert, there are three kinds of <i>razzia</i>. First of
all there is the <i>tehha</i> ["the falling," from the verb <i>tahh</i>,
"it is fallen"], which takes place at the <i>fedjeur</i>, or dawn
of day. In a <i>tehha</i>, the object is not pillage, but massacre:
no thought is given to riches, but all to vengeance.
The next is the <i>khrotefa</i>, which comes off at <i>el aasseur</i>,
or two or three in the afternoon, and means nothing
<a id='Page_197'></a>but rapine. And lastly, the <i>terbigue</i>, which is neither
war, nor an affair of brigandage, but, at most, a thievish
operation. The <i>terbigue</i> is attempted at <i>nous el leïl</i>, or
midnight. When a razzia is determined upon, those
who propose to take part in it say to one another <i>Rana
akeud</i>, "we are a knot." The enterprise is arranged, the
association formed, and a compact concluded—compact
of life and death.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c000'>
    <div>THE TEHHA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>When a <i>tehha</i> is contemplated, the sheikh issues orders
to shoe the horses, to prepare food, and to provide a
supply of barley for five or six days, more or less. These
provisions are put into a <i>semmât</i>, or wallet, each taking
his own. Previous to setting out, two or three mounted
scouts are sent forward to reconnoitre the position of the
enemy they propose to attack. The scouts are men of
intelligence, well mounted, acquainted with the country,
and circumspect. They take every precaution and make
a great circuit, so that in the event of a surprise, they
will appear from a quarter whence those whom they intend
to assail are accustomed to see only friends appear.
On arriving near to their destination, they place themselves
in ambush, and one of them, separating from the
band, penetrates on foot to the very heart of the <i>douar</i>,
without exciting the slightest suspicion. As soon as
they have obtained the necessary information respecting
the numbers and disposition of the enemy, they retrace
their steps and rejoin the <i>goum</i>, who await them at a
spot previously agreed upon. Like the scouts they, too,
have followed a path little calculated to inspire with
<a id='Page_198'></a>apprehension those whom they propose to surprise. All
necessary intelligence having been obtained, and the
foe being now near at hand, it is arranged to fall upon
him at the dawn of day, because at that hour they will
find</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The wife without her girdle,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the mare without her bridle.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Before dashing into the <i>mêlée</i>, the leaders address to
their followers a few impassioned words: "Listen. Let
no one think of despoiling the women, driving off the
horses, entering the tents, or alighting for purposes of
plunder, before taking many lives. Bear in mind that
we have to do with 'children of sin,' who will defend
themselves vigourously. These people have butchered
our brethren. No mercy! Kill! Kill! if you desire at the
same time to take revenge and the goods of your enemies.
I tell you again they will not give these up to
you without a struggle." The <i>goum</i> then breaks up into
three or four bands, with a view to strike terror into
the assailed from several different quarters at the same
time. As soon as they are within range they open fire,
but not a cry is uttered until their fire-arms have made
themselves heard.</p>

<p class='c009'>These <i>razzias</i> are for the most part frightful scenes of
carnage. The men, taken off their guard, are nearly all
put to the sword, but the women are merely stripped of
their clothing and jewels. If time permit, the victors
carry off with them the tents, the negroes, the horses,
and the flocks, leaving the women and the children, for
in the desert no one ever burdens himself with prisoners.
On their return the flocks are committed to the custody
of a few horsemen, while the others form themselves into
<a id='Page_199'></a>a strong rearguard to cover the retreat. On reaching
the <i>douar</i>, the combatants divide among themselves the
flocks and the booty captured without personal risk, and
give to the sheikh, over and above his share, thirty or
forty ewes, or three or four camels, as the case may be,
besides bestowing a special gratuity on the horsemen
who were sent forward as scouts.</p>

<p class='c009'>Previous to attempting an enterprise of this kind each
tribe places itself under the protection of a particular marabout
to whom it is in the habit of applying in difficult
circumstances. In the eyes of the Saharene, to plunder
an enemy, though an incident of no uncommon occurrence,
is an affair by no means devoid of solemnity. It is
thus that the tribe of the Arbâa regard as their regular
and accredited marabout Sidi-Hamed-ben-Salem-Ould-Tedjiny.
A successful <i>razzia</i> is celebrated by great
rejoicings. In each tent an <i>ouadâa</i>, or feast, is prepared
in honour of the marabouts, to which are invited the
poor, the <i>tolbas</i>, or men of letters, the widows, the farriers,
and the free negroes.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <i>tehha</i> is usually achieved with five or six hundred
horses, and not unfrequently foot-soldiers accompany the
expedition, mounted on camels. Sometimes the tribe
that is to be attacked has received timely warning, and
been able to adopt measures for defence. The horses
are saddled, the arms ready to the hand. A combat
takes place, instead of a massacre, and many fall on
both sides. The assailants, however, have usually the
advantage, as they are not embarrassed with women
and children like their adversaries; and it rarely happens
that they return home without booty.</p>

<p class='c009'>Perhaps I cannot do better than reproduce in this place
<a id='Page_200'></a>one of those popular chaunts which so well depict the
rage and the varying fortune of these bloody struggles,
that generally originate in love or jealousy.</p>

</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c000'>
    <div>THE KHROTEFA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The object of the <i>razzia</i> called <i>khrotefa</i> is to carry off
a flock of camels grazing at a distance of seven or eight
<a id='Page_202'></a>leagues from the tribe. From a hundred and fifty to two
hundred horsemen join together as "a knot" and set out
on the expedition. The reconnaissance is conducted in
the same manner as for the <i>tehha</i>, only the arrangements
are made with a view to arrive at the appointed spot
towards <i>el aasseur</i>—three or four in the afternoon—and
not at the <i>fedjeur</i>, or dawn of day.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the <i>razzia</i> has been accomplished, and four,
five, or six <i>ybal</i>—or flocks of one hundred camels each—have
been driven off, they divide into two parties. The
one, consisting of the weakest horses, goes forward with
the booty, while the other forms a sort of rearguard
whose duty it is, if necessary, to make head against the
enemy. After appointing a rendez-vous for the morrow,
the parties separate; but, in order to throw out the pursuers,
those who are to check the enemy follow a
different path to that taken by the drivers of the flocks.</p>

<p class='c009'>In these forays the shepherds are usually spared; nor
do they, indeed, take much trouble to defend property
that does not belong to them. But the noise and
shouting soon give the alarm. Every one saddles his
horse and gallops forward; then they halt and rally, and
finally appear in force upon the ground. Here again the
assailants have every chance in their favour. They are
on the look-out, and ready to receive the enemy. Their
horses have had time to rest, while those of the tribe
that has been plundered are exhausted and blown.
Musket shots are nevertheless exchanged, but night
supervenes; and, as soon as the darkness has thickened
so that "the eye begins to grow black," the plunderers
decamp and go off at full gallop to rejoin their comrades,
whom they overtake at sunrise. The pursuit lasts but a
<a id='Page_203'></a>short time. The conviction that the camels cannot be
recovered, and the fear of falling into an ambuscade,
soon induce the plundered tribe to return to their tents.</p>

<p class='c009'>Although the actual fighting incidental to this kind of
expedition is devoid of animation and soon interrupted
by nightfall, they who take part in it do not the less run
considerable risk. A horseman may receive a wound
sufficiently severe to disable him from continuing his
march. In that case he is lost, unless he happen to be a
personage of distinction, for then he is certain not to be
deserted. Some strong, vigourous fellow takes charge
of him, lifts him up, places him across his saddle, and
carries him home dead or alive. As for slight wounds,
with the Arab saddle they do not give much trouble, nor
do they prevent the return to the <i>goum</i>. On rejoining
the tribe, the spoils are divided among those who shared
in the <i>khrotefa</i>.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c000'>
    <div>THE TERBIGUE.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>In a <i>terbigue</i> not more than fifteen to twenty horsemen
make "a knot," and propose to drive off the flocks from
the very middle of a <i>douar</i>. They send some of their
party to reconnoitre the tribe, and arrive close to the
tents on one of the darkest nights. An isolated <i>douar</i> is
selected, to which they approach as near as two or three
hundred paces. Three of them dismount and stop, while
one goes round to the opposite side, and makes a noise
to attract the attention of the dogs. The people of the
tribe fancy it is a passing hyæna, or a jackal, and take
no notice of it. In the meanwhile the two other robbers
penetrate into the interior of the <i>douar</i>, loosen the
<a id='Page_204'></a>fastenings of ten, fifteen, or twenty camels, according
as fortune favours them, and knock their shoes together,
to frighten the liberated animals and cause them to run
away. They then make off as quickly as they can,
rejoin their horses, and all assist in collecting the
scattered camels. After that they separate into two
bands, one of which conducts the captured animals,
while the others, lagging a little behind, allow themselves
to be pursued in a different direction. If by chance
they have succeeded in letting loose the <i>faâle</i>, or stallion,
their success is certain, for all the females strive to
follow him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Since, in these operations, the secret is generally well
kept, they seldom fail, nor are accidents at all common.
Should the <i>douar</i> be on its guard, the attacking party
at once retires. They who venture upon such enterprises
are usually well mounted, and speedily escape from a
pursuit that is rendered almost impossible by the obscurity
which effaces all traces and inspires dread of ambush.
For a <i>razzia</i> of this sort, they do not hesitate to go thirty
or forty leagues.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sometimes incidents of a grotesque nature characterise
the <i>terbigue</i>. When a party of horsemen does not care
to leave a reserve to fight the enemy, they conceal themselves
in an ambuscade seven or eight hundred steps
from the <i>douar</i>; while the most experienced robber of
the band strips himself naked, and, taking only his
sword with him and tying his shoes to his head to look
like enormous ears, penetrates into the <i>douar</i>. He
carries in his hand an old saddle-bow, which he shakes
in all directions, every now and striking the earth. To
this dull sound he joins cries of alarm and terror: "The
<a id='Page_205'></a><i>goum</i>! the <i>goum</i>! up! up! We are betrayed!" The clamour,
the jumping about, the strange aspect of the individual,
and the noise of the saddle which he keeps on
shaking, strike terror into the animals. Horses, sheep,
and camels rush pell-mell out of the <i>douar</i>, and are
caught by the concealed horsemen. The others rush
out of their tents, snatch up their guns, and spring into
the saddle; but flocks and plunderers are already far
away, fleeing at full speed, and protected by the night.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <a id='Page_206'></a>
  <h2 class='c004'>THE KHRIANA, OR THEFT.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>The <i>terbigue</i> is, in fact, a robbery, but it is at the same
time almost a warlike operation—it is, at least, a <i>razzia</i>.
The strength of the party that executes the enterprise,
the importance of the wrong inflicted upon an entire
division of a tribe, the high qualities of the perpetrators
of the robbery, who, after all, are real warriors,—all these
circumstances taken together, if they do not suffice as a
justification in the eyes of scrupulous Europeans, are
esteemed in the desert as extremely plausible motives.
Since a few brave and reckless fellows have imperilled
their lives to injure a hostile tribe, there cannot be
otherwise than joy and triumph in that to which they
belong.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the <i>khriana</i>, however, we descend a step lower, and
arrive at a mere marauding expedition, executed by
professional thieves. It is no longer war, even in miniature—it
is nothing more than theft. It is no longer a
subject of rejoicing for a whole tribe, though still a
matter for praise and congratulation among friends;
always provided the robbery has not been committed on
their own or on a friendly tribe—which would be a
<a id='Page_207'></a>disgrace—but absolutely on an enemy. They say,
"Such a one is a brave man—he robs the enemy." As
may readily be imagined, all thefts are not managed in
the same manner, but are adapted to the nature of the
capture that is proposed to be made.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c000'>
    <div>HORSE-STEALING.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>This species of theft is practised towards the end of the
Mussulman month. When the moon is scarcely visible,
five or six men, having a proper understanding between
themselves, take a supply of provisions with them in their
wallets, and go forth in search of adventures. Before
starting, they give alms to the poor, and intreat them to
intercede with Allah for the success of their enterprise.
They then swear by some well-known marabout, generally
Sidi Abd-el-Kader, that, if they succeed, they will
do him homage by putting aside a portion for the unfortunate.
"O Sidi Abd-el-Kader," they exclaim, "if we
return with joy, loaded with spoils and free from accident,
we will give thee thy lance's share, if it please Allah!"</p>

<p class='c009'>On leaving the <i>douar</i> the robbers travel in broad daylight,
but, as they approach the tribe they propose to rob,
they proceed only at night, and conceal themselves, when
two or three leagues from the tents, in the bed of a river,
or among the herbage, or in the mountains. As soon as
the darkness has become dense, they issue from their
hiding-place and try the different <i>douars</i> one after the
other, stopping at last at that which seems the least
securely guarded, and where the dogs are the least wakeful.
If the robbers are six in number, four of them
remain about fifty paces from the <i>douar</i>, silent and motionless,
<a id='Page_208'></a>while the two others, the most daring and
adroit, make their way into the interior. Before separating,
they agree upon a pass-word; and then the two
thieves go to work. If they find the dogs on the watch,
they return for a third companion, whom they station a
little way off, in front of the tent guarded by the vigilant
dogs, and they themselves enter the <i>douar</i> from another
quarter. They agree upon the tent they propose to rob;
and while one of them, called the <i>gaad</i>, remains as a
sentinel beside it, the other, the <i>hammaze</i>, pushes on to
the horses. If the latter comes upon a horse or a mare,
fastened only by leather thongs ropes, he unties or cuts
the knot, seizes the animal by the <i>goulada</i>, or necklace
of talismans, and leads it to the side opposite to where
the dogs are held engaged by the <i>layahh</i>,<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c011'><sup>[76]</sup></a> the third
accomplice who was stationed for that purpose in front
of the tent. The <i>gaad</i> stays behind ready to shoot with
a pistol, or to knock down with a stone or stick, the
first man who comes out of the tent, and then to mislead
the rest by flying in a direction different to that taken by
his comrade with the horse. He then rejoins the <i>layahh</i>,
and the two quickly come up with the <i>hammaze</i>, when all
three return to their expectant companions. A second
robbery is committed, if the <i>douar</i>, buried in sleep, has
had no suspicion of what was going on; otherwise they
prepare for flight. One of them, placing his folded <i>haïk</i>
on the back of the horse so as to use it for stirrups, starts
forward at a gallop, after naming a rendez-vous for the
morrow or the day after. The others, to escape from the
pursuit which is sure to be instituted in the morning,
hide themselves during the whole of the first night. The
<a id='Page_209'></a>one who mounted the horse only continues his flight if
the theft has been committed in the first hours of the
night; otherwise, he passes the whole of the morrow
concealed in a dry and stony spot, where the animal
would leave no trace.</p>

<p class='c009'>Should the fastenings of the horse, instead of being
woollen, be of iron, the operation is more difficult. The
preliminary arrangements are the same, but, once fairly
at work, the <i>hammaze</i> cautiously raises the clog up to
the knee, and binds it there with his camel's rope, which
he throws round the animal's neck, and leads it out
very slowly. As soon as he has rejoined his comrades
and is sufficiently far from the scene of his exploits, he
bethinks him of giving his prize the liberty that is still
wanting. He therefore removes the clog by means of a
small saw, or picklock; at the worst he turns the padlock
to the outside of the animal's legs and shatters it with a
pistol ball, or else fills it with powder and blows it open.
The explosion, however, rouses the owners of the animal,
who set out in search of it, but nearly always in vain.
The night is dark, and the robbers separate; though, if
things come to the worst, they abandon their prize to
save their lives.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sometime the master of a tent is troubled by the barking
of the dogs, and awakens his people by calling out
to them, <i>El hayi rah hena</i>, "there is somebody here."
They go out, and, finding nothing, they conclude that
a hyæna, or a jackal, has occasioned the uproar, and so
turn in again. The thieves then come out of their
hiding-places, and perhaps proceed to some other <i>douar</i>
that is less upon the watch.</p>

<p class='c009'>In preparing for a <i>khriana</i>, each one provides himself
<a id='Page_210'></a>with a pistol which he secretes under his burnous, a
knife, a thick cudgel with a cord at one end, and a poniard.
If a robber fancies that the dogs will distinguish
him because of the whiteness of his garments, he leaves
them with his comrades, and enters the <i>douar</i> entirely
naked, his knife in one hand and the cudgel in the other.
It is a popular belief in the Sahara that a man in a
complete state of nudity is invisible in a dark night. A
vicious horse, or one that is thoroughbred, or entire, is
safe from robbers. Their habit of neighing on seeing
a man would betray the plunderers. To avoid being
scented by the dogs the precaution is taken to stalk up
the wind. There are likewise other details which should
not be neglected—the absence of moonlight, for instance.
The twenty-first of the Mussulman month is the
right time for setting out, and the night of the twenty-second
is usually the most favourable for the execution
of the enterprise. Dust and a high wind are useful
allies, but rain is treacherous, for, by moistening the soil
so as to retain foot-marks, it favours the pursuit. The
cold season is the best for robberies of this character.
There is a common saying: "In winter, cattle-stealing,
because the dog sleeps in the tent. In summer, theft in
the tent, because the dog goes away to sleep."</p>

<p class='c009'>Like all other Arabs, the robber believes that Allah
does not disdain to give him warnings—whence superstitious
hopes and fears. If, on leaving the <i>douar</i>, he
meets a black mare, dirty, lean, and altogether in bad
condition, it is an evil omen and he goes back again.
Another bad sign is to hear yourself called by people
who know not whither you are going. To see two
partridges is an auspicious augury, but one by itself
<a id='Page_211'></a>portends calamity. To find yourself, on starting, confronted
by a cheerful, courageous person, well dressed,
and well mounted, infallibly betokens success. An old
woman, blind or maimed, and covered with rags, will
certainly prevent you from succeeding. Start, however,
with perfect confidence, if you have met a beautiful
woman, richly dressed, to whom you have said: "Open
thy girdle, Fatma, for that will bring us good fortune."
She will not refuse to open to you the door to riches.
It is equally desirable to see on one's road a woman
carrying milk, and to drink a mouthful of it.</p>

<p class='c009'>On their return, the robbers divide their spoils. The
vow made to the marabouts who were invoked is scrupulously
fulfilled. The chief of the <i>douar</i>, and the woman
who opened her girdle, each receives a present. The
share that falls to the lot of the <i>hammaze</i> is the largest;
for it is he who has played the most important part, and
incurred the greatest risks.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c000'>
    <div>CAMEL-STEALING.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Camel-stealing is practised in the same manner as
horse-stealing. They choose full grown camels,—or, at
least, such as no longer cry—or she-camels with foal.
Having removed the clogs, the robbers prick the animal
with a poniard or knife to make it go off, and get on its
back as soon as they are far enough away from the
tents. All that night they travel on, and if at daybreak
they do not feel that they have gone sufficiently far to
escape the pursuit of horsemen, they halt and conceal
themselves in a spot the soil of which does not retain
foot-marks. The pursuers give up the chace if they
<a id='Page_212'></a>find no traces of the fugitives. In the other event they
often recover what they have lost; and, unless the robbers
let go their prize and hide themselves, they may pay for
their daring with their life.<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c011'><sup>[77]</sup></a> This is the supreme moment
for invocations and vows. "O Sidi Abd-el-Kader,"
cries the robber, on seeing the enemy close at hand, and
in dread of discovery, "if thou wilt save us yet this one
time, we will make in thy honour an <i>ouadâa</i> for the
poor." In the Sahara, Sidi Abd-el-Kader-el-Djilaly is the
patron of robbers. This very undesirable patronage is
due to the charity of the holy marabout, who shrinks
from leaving in trouble those who invoke his name.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c000'>
    <div>SHEEP-STEALING.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Sheep are but a poor prey, and more troublesome than
profitable. They walk slowly, and it is impossible to
drive them far enough away by the day after the theft.
The Arabs, therefore, content themselves with stealing
from an enemy, in his absence, to feed themselves while
lying in ambush. Nevertheless, the opportunity is sometimes
tempting. A flock is seen grazing at a distance
from the <i>douars</i>. The shepherd is lying down, asleep,
or in some other way occupied. It is yet early morning,
and there is time to cover a considerable distance before
sunset, when the flocks are driven home, and the theft
is likely to be discovered. Sometimes, therefore, they
risk the hazard. Striking the negligent shepherd a
heavy blow on the head with a stick, they throw dust
<a id='Page_213'></a>into his eyes, and, tying his hands behind him, draw
over his face the hood of his burnous. The robbers then
share with one another the task of driving off the flock,
broken up into small sections, each taking a separate
course, and going slowly at first, but after a while quickening
their pace. On the morrow, after traversing
none but lonely paths, they meet again at an appointed
spot. In an affair of this kind they take the shepherd
with them, and set him free only in the middle of the
night, when they have nothing more to fear from him.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <a id='Page_214'></a>
  <h2 class='c004'>WAR BETWEEN DESERT TRIBES.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>A caravan has been plundered—the women of the tribe
have been insulted—the right of water and pasturage
has been disputed. These are wrongs which no <i>razzia</i>,
not even the terrible <i>tehha</i>, can sufficiently avenge. The
chiefs, therefore, assemble and decide upon war. Then
they write to the chiefs of all their allied tribes, and
claim their aid. The allies are loyal and faithful—are
they not also enemies of the tribe to be chastised? Have
they not the same sympathies, the same interests, as those
who summon them? Are they not an integral part of
the confederation? Not a single tribe will refuse to send
a contingent in proportion to its importance. But the
allies are distant. They cannot arrive within a week or
ten days, and in the meantime counsels are taken, and
the passion of the warriors excited by the proclamations
of the chiefs:—</p>

<p class='c009'>"You are warned, O servants of Allah! that we have
to exact vengeance from such a tribe that has offered us
such or such an insult. Shoe your horses. Supply
yourselves with provisions for a fortnight. Forget not
the wheat, the barley, the dried meat, and the butter.
<a id='Page_215'></a>You must provide not only for your own wants, but also
that you may be able to afford a generous hospitality to
the horsemen of such and such tribes that are coming to
our assistance. Command your prettiest women to hold
themselves in readiness to accompany us, and to array
themselves in their finest garments, and adorn their
camels and litters to the utmost of their power. Do
you yourselves also put on your handsomest dresses, for
with us it is a matter of <i>nif</i> [self-love]. Keep your arms
in good condition. Supply yourselves with powder, and
be assembled on such a day at such a spot. The horseman
who owns a mare and does not come, the foot-soldier
who possesses a gun and stays at home, shall be fined,
the former twenty ewes and the latter ten."</p>

<p class='c009'>Every able-bodied man, though he should have to go
on foot, is bound to join in the expedition. Before setting
out, the chiefs confide the flocks, tents, and baggage
of the tribe to the care of experienced veterans, who are
likewise charged to exercise a sort of police supervision
over this assembly of women, children, invalids, and
shepherds.</p>

<p class='c009'>The enemy, on their part, likewise make their preparations.
Warned by travellers, by friends, and even by
relatives whom they claim in the opposite party, they
hasten to write in all directions to assemble their allies.
Their flocks, tents, and baggage they place in a secure
spot, and then assign a rendez-vous to the horsemen
with the least possible delay. To guard against a
surprise, they select a position suitable for defence, and
await whatever may happen. They have not long to
wait. The tribe that has taken up arms to avenge itself
is very soon on the march, for it has not lost a single
<a id='Page_216'></a>moment. On the evening before their departure, all the
auxiliary chiefs join those who have summoned them,
and, in the presence of the marabouts, take the following
oath on the sacred book of Sidi Abd-Allah:—</p>

<p class='c009'>"O friends! let us swear by the truth of the sacred
book of Sidi Abd-Allah that we are brothers, that all our
guns shall be as one, and that, in dying, we will all die
by the same sabre. If you call us by day, we will come
by day, and if you summon us by night, we will hasten
to you by night."</p>

<p class='c009'>Having taken this oath, they arrange to start on the
following morning. At the appointed hour a man of
high birth, noble among the noblest, mounts on horseback,
orders his women, borne on camels, to follow him,
and gives the signal. There is a general movement,
and all set out. The eye is dazzled by the strange and
picturesque confusion, the many-hued crowd of horses,
warriors, and camels bearing rich palanquins in which
the women are inclosed. Here are the foot-soldiers, who
march by themselves—there the horsemen, who superintend
the female procession. Others, again, more impetuous
and thoughtless, dash on in front or spread out on
the flanks, but rather as hunters than as scouts, and
with their greyhounds run down the gazelle, the hare,
the antelope, and the ostrich. The chiefs, however, are
more serious. Upon their shoulders rests the whole
responsibility. To them will accrue the largest share of
the plunder, if the expedition succeed; and upon them,
also, in the event of failure, will fall imprecations, ruin,
and shame. They, therefore, consult together and form
their plans. Lastly, come the camels that carry the
supplies. Thus the host advances, adapting itself to
<a id='Page_217'></a>the irregularities of the ground, all in wild confusion,
every one noisy and joyous, thinking much of the adventure,
nothing of the fatigue, dreaming of glory, not
of danger. The warriors relate their former exploits,
while the players on the flute accompany them, inspiriting
or interrupting them, and the women utter joyful
cries. And above all this uproar are heard the loud
reports of fire-arms. The firing ceases, and a young
and handsome horseman strikes up one of those love-songs,
through which the ardour of their passion scatters
strange images and striking colours, and which, in the
desert, have always a fresh charm for these chivalrous
nations.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the end of a few hours the heat becomes unpleasant,
and a halt is called. The tents are pitched, breakfast is
prepared, and the horses are unbridled and allowed to
graze—and all rest themselves. As the sun goes down,
the heat diminishes—it is now between two and three
in the afternoon. To your saddles and forward, ye
daring cavaliers! Display in a brilliant fantasia the
worth of your horses and of yourselves. The women
behold you; show them what you can do with a horse
and a gun. Ah! more than one of you shall be rewarded
for his prowess. Do you see that negro? He is bearing
to one of you the recompense of his skill in managing
his arms and his steed. He is the messenger to whose
care one of the lovely spectators has confided the secret
of her love, in charging him to deliver to the hero of the
fantasia her <i>khrolkhral</i>, or anklets, or her <i>mekhranga</i>, or
necklace of cloves.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is not enough, however, to be a brave and skilful
horseman—it is incumbent on thee, also, to be discreet.
Thou hast a friend; to-morrow thou wilt give him thy
horse and thy garments. Urge him strongly, for thy
sister<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c011'><sup>[83]</sup></a> wishes it, to show himself in the midst of the
<a id='Page_221'></a><i>goum</i> upon thy steed and in thy dress, so as to deceive
the other horsemen. In the mean time thou wilt pass
unperceived as a humble foot-soldier, and wilt walk
beside the camel that bears thy mistress. Attention!
watch the favourable moment, and slip into her palanquin.
She is just as impatient as thyself, and stretches
her hand to thee. Profit by this assistance, and let thy
movements outstrip suspicion.</p>

<p class='c009'>In love, as in war, fortune favours the bold, but they
have likewise the largest share of perils. If such meetings
are frequent and nearly always successful, there
is nevertheless risk to life; for, if the lovers are ever
surprised, both of them perish without mercy. But who
is there to betray them? All who surround them are in
their favour. The lover tells his good fortune to his
friends, all of whom are anxious to forward his happiness,
and ten or a dozen <i>douros</i> have been sent to his
mistress. Nor is this all. Her confidential servant has
received two or three <i>douros</i>, and money has been freely
distributed among her slaves and attendants. All,
therefore, keep a good watch, and give timely notice to
the lover when he must glide out of the litter, in the
midst of the disorder and confusion caused by the pitching
of the camp at the approach of night.</p>

<p class='c009'>Previous to sunset, the chiefs reconnoitre a spot suitable
for an encampment. It must be supplied with
water, grass, and shrubs for fire-wood. On arriving at
the place selected, each tent is pitched, the horses are
unbridled and hobbled, as are also the camels, the
negroes go in search of wood and grass, the women
prepare the food, and they all sup. A thousand little
scenes impart to a camp of this kind an aspect full of
<a id='Page_222'></a>charm and novelty. Then total darkness envelopes the
scene, unless there happens to be moonlight. The fires
are extinguished—there is nothing alight to diminish
the darkness. In the Sahara, oil and wax are alike
unknown. Immediately after supper, each tent selects
a man to watch the animals and the baggage. It is his
business to prevent thefts, which his most active
vigilance is, nevertheless, powerless to avert.</p>

<p class='c009'>Not robbers alone wait for the night. Protected by
the same obscurity, the lover, with the privity of his
mistress, cautiously approaches the tent in which she
reposes, raises the canvass, and guided by a devoted
slave, takes the place of the husband who, fatigued by
the day's journey, is sleeping in the men's chamber,—for
in the tents of the desert there are always two distinct
compartments, one for men, the other for women.
Besides, it is deemed disgraceful for a man to pass the
whole night by the side of his wife. There is nothing
therefore, to interfere with these clandestine meetings.
The presence of the two or three other wives permitted
by the Mussulman law would certainly not be considered
an obstacle. According, to an Arab proverb, only a
Jewess surpasses Shitan in trickery, but next to Shitan
comes the Mussulmanee. It is a thing unheard of in the
desert that women should denounce one another. But
if, perchance, the adventure should seem too hazardous,
the woman issues from the tent when every one is
asleep, and proceeds to a spot she has indicated to her
lover by means of one of the usual intermediary agents,
the negroes and shepherds.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the very hour that happy lovers meet, are accomplished
schemes of vengeance. A rejected lover penetrates
<a id='Page_223'></a>into the tent of the woman who has treated him
with scorn, goes up to her, and shoots her with a pistol.
At the sound of the explosion, the other women jump
up, run against one another, and utter shrieks. The
murderer, however, has had time to disappear, and the
crime, perpetrated unseen, nearly always remains unpunished.
Love adventures are common in the Sahara.
Willingly or unwillingly, an Arab woman is sure to
have lovers. The jealous precautions of the husbands
excite and foment to an unnatural degree the libertine
propensities of the women, by the very restraints that are
placed upon them. To whatever class they belong, they
pass their time in inventing stratagems to deceive their
husbands while they are young, and, when they are old,
to facilitate the amours of others.</p>

<p class='c009'>The night is over; the sky is covered with a golden
light; it is time to depart. The chiefs now send forward
scouts to reconnoitre the enemy's position, and to form
an opinion, from external signs, of his moral condition,
and of the reinforcements he has received. The scouts
advance very cautiously, and, when they are nearing the
hostile camp, travel only at night. One of them is then
detached on foot, who takes advantage of every irregularity
of the ground to avoid being noticed, and oftentimes,
disguised in rags, penetrates boldly into the midst
of the <i>douars</i>. There he makes himself acquainted with
the number of foot-soldiers, horses, and tents; observes
whether they are laughing and amusing themselves, or
if sadness reigns in the camp; and then returns to communicate
the result of his investigations. The scouts
remain all night in a concealed spot, impatient to discover
what will be the attitude of the enemy at sunrise.
<a id='Page_224'></a>If he executes the fantasia and discharges his fire-arms,—if
shouts of joy are heard, and singing, and the
sound of the flute,—it is certain that he has received
reinforcements, and troubles himself very little about the
approaching attack.</p>

<p class='c009'>The tribe continues its march until it is not above nine
or ten leagues from the enemy. The advance has been
made by short stages. The baggage, the women, the
foot-soldiers, are so many causes of delay; but what has
chiefly retarded the advance are the orders of the chiefs,
who are desirous to afford time for reflection to those they
proposed to chastise. It was acting prudently, and they
were influenced by powerful motives. Who knew but
that terms of peace might be asked for, accompanied by
many presents for themselves, the leading councillors?
Examples were not wanting to that effect—indeed, it
was the usual custom. For them would be the cotton
stuffs, the garments of cloth, the guns mounted in silver,
the anklets, and the <i>douros</i>! When an affair takes such
turn as this, an amicable arrangement is not far distant.</p>

<p class='c009'>The two hostile bands are at length divided from one
another by no more than ten leagues, and no propositions,
direct or indirect, have been exchanged. Does
the tribe recognise the impossibility of resistance, or will
it accept battle? If it declines the contest, it assembles
the most influential marabouts, and furnishes them with
money and presents, towards which each individual has
contributed his share. These holy men then proceed to
the opposite camp in the middle of the night, under the
protection of a chief who has received timely notice of
their coming, after being seduced by their gifts. By
him they are conducted to another, who is in like manner
<a id='Page_225'></a>induced to accept the presents offered to him. The two
now accompany the messengers of peace to a third chief,
and so on to others, until they have gained the votes of
all the most powerful. Then, and not till then, do the
marabouts, secure of a friendly audience, unfold the
propositions they are instructed to make—expressing
themselves after this fashion:—"We have come only
for the love of Allah. You know we are marabouts, and
that we desire only what is right. For our sake, you
must come to terms with the Mussulmans who have sent
us. That is far better than bringing down upon us all
the calamities of war, ruin and death. If you will do
what is right, Allah will bless you, yourselves, your
wives, your children, your mares, and your she-camels.
If you choose what is wrong, may it recoil upon your
own heads. We repeat, make peace, and may Allah
curse the demon!"</p>

<p class='c009'>Having first raised a few difficulties for form's sake,
the chiefs finish by saying in reply to the marabouts:—"Well!
we will make peace for the sake of Allah, and
for your sake, but on the following conditions: 1st, You
will restore to us the objects, goods or animals, which
were taken from us when your people robbed our caravan
at such a place. 2nd, You will pay the <i>dya</i><a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c011'><sup>[84]</sup></a> of
our people slain by yours on such a day. 3rd, You will
restore to us all the flocks that were carried off from
us by your people on such a day, in such a <i>khrotefa</i>.
4th, You will restore to us all the camels and horses
which your thieves have stolen from us, and which are
still within your bounds."</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='Page_226'></a>The marabouts accept these conditions, and guarantee
their fulfilment. The sacred book of Sidi Abd-Allah is
then produced, and the chiefs swear to make peace.
After the oath has been taken, they who have come to
prevent the shedding of blood return to their tribe, to
give an account of what has been decided, and compel
them to execute the terms which they have just guaranteed.
On the morrow the tribe that has accorded
peace continues its march, and encamps within a league
of the enemy. It is barely installed, when the marabouts
and chiefs of the opposite party arrive with the ratification
that was stipulated. The leading men of the two
rival camps meet together, and again swear on the book
of Sidi Abd-Allah:—"By the truth of Sidi Abd-Allah,
we swear that there shall not again be between us <i>razzia</i>,
or theft, or murder, or reprisals [<i>ousiga</i>], that we are
brothers, and that our guns shall henceforth fire in
accord."</p>

<p class='c009'>The marabouts of both parties next read the <i>fatahh</i>, or
religious invocation, and conclude with these words:
"Allah bless you, our children, for having thus buried
the knife of contention, and prosper you in your families
and in your goods!" The marabouts are afterwards
visited by the chiefs of both sides who present to them
offerings called <i>zyara</i>, literally a visit.</p>

<p class='c009'>Peace concluded, the tribe that had put itself into
motion retraces its steps, and at its departure executes
a fantasia of the most noisy character. The horses
caracole, reports of fire-arms resound, and the women
utter loud cries. All is joy, happiness, and delirium. A
dozen of the chiefs of this tribe remain in the midst of
their late enemies, and receive from them a splendid
<a id='Page_227'></a>hospitality, and even costly presents. And at their
departure they take with them some of their hosts, and
requite their new-found friends with a generous welcome.
These truces last a considerable time; that is,
from one to two years.</p>

<p class='c009'>Peace, however, would certainly not have been
concluded if the marabouts who came to intercede for it
had not presented themselves under cover of the night.
Had they come in the day time, the Arabs, discerning
their intrigues, would have exclaimed out of jealousy:
"By the sin of our women! we will fight. This one has
received cloth-goods, that one money, another jewels, a
fourth cotton-stuffs, and that other one arms. But we,
whose brothers are dead, whose flocks have been carried,
we have got nothing. Yes, we swear it by Sidi Abd-Allah,
the powder shall speak." And, in truth, the
powder very often does speak, and without the envious
having had any cause to complain of the presents made
to their chiefs, and without their having prevented the
latter from entering into negotiations, and accepting
conditions from which no advantage would accrue to the
commonality. This happens when the tribe threatened
has resolved to oppose force to force, and has prepared
for a struggle.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the latter event the enemy is allowed to approach
within a day's march. No advances are made, no propositions
offered. The march is therefore continued on
the morrow, and the camp is pitched about two leagues
from that of the tribe which awaits the assault. The
scouts of the two parties come into collision, and, mutually
exasperating each another, prelude actual hostilities
by insults. A few musket shots are exchanged, and
<a id='Page_228'></a>they cry out to one another:— "O Fatma, daughters
of Fatma! The night has arrived; why go on to-day?
To-morrow shall be called your day." Or, "Dogs, sons
of dogs, wait till to-morrow! If you are men, you will
meet us."</p>

<p class='c009'>The skirmishers fall back, and the leaders on both
sides organise as quickly as possible a guard of one
hundred horsemen and one hundred foot-soldiers, to
insure the safety of the camp. On the morrow they
watch each other attentively. If one party strike their
tents, the others do the same; or if they leave their
tents pitched, and advance to the combat with horses and
foot, and with the women mounted on camels, the
example is followed on the other side. The cavaliers of
the two tribes confront one another. The women are
placed in the rear, ready to excite the combatants by
their cries and applause, and are themselves protected
by the foot-soldiers who form the reserve. The battle
begins by small parties of ten or a dozen horsemen
bearing down upon the flanks, and trying to turn the
enemy. The chiefs, at the head of a tolerably compact
mass, keep in the centre. Presently the affair grows
warm and animated. The bravest and best mounted of
the young men dash forward, carried away by passion
and the thirst for blood. Uncovering their heads, they
strike up their war-songs, and excite themselves by loud
outcries:—</p>

<p class='c009'>"Where are they who have mistresses? It is beneath
their eyes that the warriors will combat this day!</p>

<p class='c009'>"Where are they who, in the presence of the chiefs,
were always boasting of their valour? It is to-day that
tongues should be long, and not in peaceful gossipings.</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='Page_229'></a>"Where are they who run after fame?</p>

<p class='c009'>"Forward, sons of powder! You see before you those
sons of Jews! Our sabre shall drink of their blood, and
their goods we will give to our women.</p>

<p class='c009'>"Strike out, young men! Strike out! It is not the
balls that kill, but fate."</p>

<p class='c009'>These shouts madden the horsemen. They make their
steeds rear up on end, and fire off their pieces. Every
face asks for blood. They rush together, and at last
attack each other with the sabre. One party or the
other, however, soon gives way, and begins to fall back
upon the camels carrying the women. Then shrieks
arise from both sides. These scream with joy, to animate
yet more the victors—those utter wrathful and
terrible imprecations, to rally the failing courage of their
husbands and brothers.</p>

<p class='c009'>"Look at those famous warriors who show off with
their bright stirrups and splendid garments at marriage
feasts and festivals! Look at them running away and
abandoning even their women! O Jews, and sons of
Jews! alight and let us mount your horses, and from
henceforth you shall no longer be counted among men.
Oh! Allah curse all cowards!"</p>

<p class='c009'>These railings recall the spirit of the vanquished.
They make a vigorous effort, and, supported by the fire
of the foot-soldiers who are in reserve, they recover the
lost ground, and even hurl the enemy back into the
midst of his own women, who now rail as loudly as they
lately applauded. The struggle is renewed on the
ground that separates the women of the two tribes.
During these varying phases the contest has been very
desperate, and before long the side that has most men
<a id='Page_230'></a>and horses wounded, that has lost the greatest number,
and, above all, that has witnessed the fall of its most
valiant chiefs, takes to flight, notwithstanding the exhortations
and prayers of a few energetic men, who fly from
right to left, trying to rally the fugitives and restore the
fight. These brave fellows cry aloud:— "Are there
any men here, or are there not? Hold your own souls!
If you flee, they will carry off your women and leave you
nothing but shame. Die! Let it not be said: 'They
fled!' Die! and you will yet live!"</p>

<p class='c009'>A beautiful and touching scene will, perhaps, then
be enacted. A chief of the highest rank, in despair at
being defeated, throws himself into the <i>mêlée</i> to seek
death, but is held back by the young men who gather
round him, and beseech him to retire. "Thou art our
father!" they will exclaim; "What will become of us if
thou shouldst perish? It is our duty to die for thee.
We will not remain as sheep without a shepherd." A
handful of warriors still endeavour to make head against
the foe, but they are swept away in the general rout,
and soon find themselves by the side of their women.
Every one, then, seeing that all is lost, devotes himself
to saving what is dearest to him. As rapidly as possible
they make to the rear, only from time to time facing
about to check the pursuit of the enemy.</p>

<p class='c009'>The audacity of desperation has more than once changed
the face of things. Aïssa-ben-el-Sheriff, a child of
fourteen, mounted on horseback with his tribe to repel
an attack directed by Sid-el-Djedid. The Arbâa were
beginning to give way and take to flight, when the boy,
throwing himself before them, tried to stop them: "What!"
he exclaimed, "You are men, and are afraid! You have
<a id='Page_231'></a>been brought up in the midst of powder, and do not
know how to burn it! Did you pay all that attention to
your mares only to make use of them in flight?" And
when the others replied, "Djedid! Djedid! Look at
Djedid!" "Djedid," continued the child. "It is a
single man that makes you flee! Behold, then, this
terrible warrior, who puts hundreds to the rout, checked
in his victorious career by a child!" With these words
he dashed his spurs into his horse's flanks, and came up
with the redoubtable warrior. Djedid, fearing nothing
from a mere boy, was off his guard, but the latter threw
himself round his neck, entwined his arms round him,
and, leaving his own horse, hung by one arm, while
with the other he endeavoured to stab him with his
knife. Astonished at such audacity, and hampered in his
movements, Djedid strove in vain to shake him off, but
with all his presence of mind he was unable to parry the
boy's frequent thrusts. Puzzled what to do, he slipped
off his horse, hoping to crush Aïssa in his fall. The
latter, however, succeeded in avoiding him, and throwing
himself on the courser of the dreaded chief, rejoined
his tribe, to whom he exhibited a trophy that made the
oldest warrior blush for the momentary panic to which
they had yielded.</p>

<p class='c009'>Were it not that the conquerors usually build a golden
bridge for the conquered, the latter might be easily
destroyed; but the thirst for pillage gains the day, and
the victors disperse in search of plunder. One despoils
a foot-soldier, another a horseman whom he has overthrown;
another, again, leads away a steed, and yet
another a negro. Thanks to this disorder, the bravest of
the discomfited tribe succeed in saving their women, and
<a id='Page_232'></a>even their tents. When the pillage is at an end, the
horsemen of the victorious tribe are anxious to return
home, and their chiefs encourage the desire. "We have
slain numbers," say they. "We have seized their
horses, captured their women, taken their guns, and
refreshed our souls by making orphans of these sons of
dogs. Our best plan now is to go and sleep at such a
place, for the enemy, strengthened by his reinforcements,
may possibly resume the offensive and attack us during
the night." The baggage is sent forward in front,
and, protected by a strong rearguard, during the first
few days they continue their march until nightfall.</p>

<p class='c009'>In this species of warfare, the greatest respect is
shown to the captive women. Men of low birth, indeed,
despoil them of their jewels, but the chiefs make it a
point of honour to restore them to their husbands, with
their camels, their jewels, and their ornaments. They
even take pains to properly array those who have been
robbed, before sending them back.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the desert, they make no prisoners, and cut off no
heads, and they have a horror of mutilating the wounded,
who are left, however, to themselves to escape or perish,
for no one takes any trouble about them. Rare examples
of cruelty do sometimes occur, but these are acts of
private revenge, when men have recognised the murderers
of those who were dear to them, a friend or
brother.</p>

<p class='c009'>On reaching their own territory, the tribe is welcomed
by extraordinary rejoicings. The universal exultation
betrays itself by the liveliest demonstrations. The women
draw up their camels in a single row, and utter
cries of joy at regular intervals. The young men execute
<a id='Page_233'></a>in their presence a fantasia of the wildest description.
Salutations, embraces, and interrogations are exchanged
on all sides. Food is prepared for the warriors and their
allies, and the chiefs collect the sum that is to be divided
among them. A common horseman never receives less
than ten <i>douros</i>, or an article of equal value. This recompense,
called <i>zebeun</i>, is obligatory, and is given over
and above the plunder each may have seized for himself;
and, in addition to this, three camels are bestowed upon
every cavalier who has lost a horse. It is needless to
add that a larger sum than ten <i>douros</i> is offered to the
chiefs of the allied tribes, whose influence has been so
successful. They receive their share like the others, but
in secret they are presented with money, or articles of
considerable value, such as carpets, tents, arms, horses,
etc., etc.</p>

<p class='c009'>A generous hospitality is offered to the allies; and on
the morrow, when they set out to return to their own
territories, the chiefs mount on horseback and accompany
them. After riding on together for two or three
hours, they renew the mutual oath never to raise but one
war-shout, never to make but one and the same gun, to
come in the morning if summoned in the morning, and
to come at night if summoned at night. In the desert,
if feuds are keen and hereditary, sympathies, on the
other hand, are also numerous and profound. The
following verses illustrate the extreme degree of delicacy
and devotedness to which the sentiment of friendship is
carried by the Arabs:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>If a friend does not walk as blindly as a child,</div>
      <div class='line'>If he does not voluntarily expose himself to death,</div>
      <div class='line in6'>Forgetting that suicide is a crime,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in8'><a id='Page_234'></a>He shall have no place in the tents of our tribes.</div>
      <div class='line in12'>I will obey the summons of my friend.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Though the morning light should be the reflection of swords,</div>
      <div class='line'>Though the darkness of night should be the cloud of dust raised</div>
      <div class='line in2'>by the tramp of horses,</div>
      <div class='line in14'>I will go to die or to be happy.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The smallest of the sacrifices to which I have agreed is death.</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Can I live far away from the place of refuge so dear to me?</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Can I support the absence of neighbours to whom I have become</div>
      <div class='line in4'>accustomed.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>It may be naturally asked why a tribe that is menaced
with an attack, but will not make the necessary sacrifices
to obtain peace, does not flee, instead of awaiting
the assault. To flee, is to invite pursuit while in the
disorder of a retreat. It means leaving one's country,
exposing oneself to scarcity of water for the flocks, or
even falling into the hands of some other enemy, who
would certainly take advantage of this opportunity for
pillage and revenge. The wisest plan is to choose a
good position, assemble the allies, and await the enemy
if confident in one's own strength, or else to make concessions
if conscious of weakness.</p>

above all the tribes collected in the great assemblies?
Do we not advance against the enemy on horses of pure

<p class='c009'>I have prepared, against the time when fortune shall be

and which none can rival in swiftness.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>USAGES OF WAR.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>On returning to their <i>douars</i> after a <i>razzia</i>, or an
expedition, the Arabs of the desert proceed to divide the
spoils in equal shares, a certain portion being set aside
for special cases. Thus a cavalier who has slain another
in battle is entitled to the horse of the deceased, to his
arms, garments, harness, pouch, and <i>djebira</i>. "In fact,
he has risked a life to take a life, and will have to
answer before Allah for the death he has inflicted,
rightly or wrongly." A horse that is captured without
its owner being killed, is comprised among the general
stock to be divided. If a horseman has been slain by
several persons firing simultaneously, without it being
clearly shown by whose hand he fell, his spoils are
equally shared by all. In some tribes, the plunder
reverts to the chief when it cannot be proved from whose
gun the fatal ball was fired. Should a cavalier learn
after the fight is over, that he has killed an enemy with
his own hand, and be able to produce witnesses to the
deed, he obtains restitution of the entire plunder of the
slain.</p>

<p class='c009'>When a tribe makes an expedition against another
<a id='Page_237'></a>tribe, each individual retains whatever he has taken in
<i>haïks</i>, burnouses, arms, and garments; but tents, flocks,
horses, mules, camels, provisions, and grain, are public
property. The chief alone is entitled, over and above an
ordinary share, to thirty or forty ewes, or three or four
camels, as the case may be. Even should he not have
accompanied the tribe in person, he would still be assigned
what is called the <i>akeud ek-sheikh</i>, or the sheikh's
knot. If any one, not caring to join the expedition, has
lent his mare to a friend, he shares the booty acquired
by the latter. If the animal be killed and any prize is
made, the value of the mare is deducted and paid over to
her owner, for she had gone for the service of the tribe.
Should the result be unfavourable, the owner puts up
with his loss—"he sought his good fortune."</p>

<p class='c009'>Whoever offers a supply of food to a party of horsemen
is entitled to a share if the party prove successful, as he
was interested in the expedition.</p>

<p class='c009'>A "lance" [one share] is given to the farrier of the
tribe, for he contributes his skill and labour to the
success of the enterprise. To kill a farrier is deemed
infamous. It is a deed that will recoil upon the guilty
tribe, who will be pursued by a curse ever after.</p>

<p class='c009'>He who takes off his burnous and goes up to the
enemy with the butt end of his rifle in the air, must also
be spared.</p>

<p class='c009'>Shepherds, likewise, have their life accorded to them.</p>

<p class='c009'>A special share of the plunder is reserved for those
who have been sent forward as scouts previous to the
attack upon the enemy. It is their just recompense for
offering their lives to secure the triumph of their brethren.
If a scout loses his mare, he is compensated by
<a id='Page_238'></a>one hundred ewes, or another mare, or by one hundred
Spanish <i>douros</i>. There is no exaggeration in this estimate,
for it is always the best mounted who are selected.
If a band returns with booty, a "lance" is
bestowed upon the woman of distinction who goes forth
from her tent, and lifts up her voice in honour of the
victors. In an affair of <i>nif</i> (self-love), the pretty women
who accompany the expedition to animate the combatants
are entitled to a share of the spoils. Whoever
lends his rifle, receives one-fourth of the share that falls
to the lot of the borrower.</p>

<p class='c009'>Suppose an Arab finds a horse at pasture away from
its owner, at a time when his tribe happens to be attacked,
or is on the point of setting out on an expedition.
Suppose he takes the animal, and places on its back a
borrowed saddle. Suppose, further, that this saddle is
not complete; but that he gets stirrups from one, a girth
from another, a bridle and a breast-band from a third,
until at last he is completely equipped. He sets out and
returns with plunder; but the proprietor of the horse has
no right to any portion of it. Had the animal been
killed, the owner would have been reimbursed, in the
event of success; but if it is brought back safe and sound,
he cannot claim anything: "The animal has been nothing
more than an instrument of Allah to render service
to the brave horseman who exposed himself for the
public good." The proprietors, however, of the different
parts of the equipment are entitled to a share. The
wanderers of the desert have an apologue quite in the
Arab style which exactly defines the respective dues of
each:</p>

<p class='c009'>"Quoth the saddle-tree to the horseman: 'Do you
<a id='Page_239'></a>purpose to keep all the prize to yourself? Who furnished
you with a seat? What would you have done had you
not found me there?'</p>

<p class='c009'>"A pretty story!" exclaims the girth. "The service
you brag of, was it after all so very great? Why, you
would have done more harm than good, had I not held
you on the horse's back."</p>

<p class='c009'>"Gently, gently!" cry the stirrups. "I acknowledge
you may both of you have been useful in your way; but
pray tell me who supported the horseman when he
dashed forward? On whom did he lean when he made
use of his rifle to bring down the enemy from whom he
took the spoils about which you are wrangling so
sharply? Who was it that enabled him to look far ahead,
to stoop down, or turn round, according as he wished to
strike a blow, or to avoid one with which he was
threatened?"</p>

<p class='c009'>"It was you," replied the bridle. "There is no denying
the truth. And yet, O my sons, by Allah, master of
the world! our horseman would not have much riches to
boast of to-day had he employed only your services. You
did not take the road to the plunder, and assuredly you
would be far enough from it now had I not guided you.
Cease, then, these disputes. The palm is mine, for it
was I alone who enabled you to reach the goal."</p>

<p class='c009'>"Ah! that is rather too much of a good thing!" the
horse ironically observes, after listening thus far without
uttering a word. "Somehow I fancied that the greatest
praise was due to myself. I thought I had seen you
lying forgotten in a corner, and that you were picked
up only because I had been found. I was dreaming, no
doubt, and it is you who have carried me. I own that I
<a id='Page_240'></a>was mistaken. Take me back, then, as quickly as
possible to my pasture, or at least let me hear no more of
your squabbles."</p>

<p class='c009'>"To put an end to all this jangling, the horseman
divided his booty into six equal parts, one of which he
gave to the saddle-tree, one to the girth, and one to the
bridle, and kept the three others for himself. Leading
the horse back to the pasture he said to him: 'I do not
give thee anything, for thou hast the honour of having
been useful to thy tribe.'"</p>

<p class='c009'>If any one lends a saddle complete, he is entitled to
one-half share. This distribution is called <i>âadet esserdj</i>,
or the custom of the saddle.</p>

<p class='c009'>When on the point of starting on an expedition, the
<i>goum</i> offers up the following invocations:
"O Sidi Abd-el-Kader-el-Djilaly!
O Sidi-Sheik-ben-el-Dine! O Sidi-el-Hadj-bou-Hafeus!
If we succeed and return safe and
sound, we promise a camel to each of you. Protect us!"
Before any division takes place these three camels are
always put aside for the marabouts.</p>

<p class='c009'>The division of the plunder, as may be imagined, is
never carried out without many remonstrances, for the
prevention or repression of which the <i>mekadim</i> were
instituted. Sometimes the chiefs make choice of five or
six individuals of approved discretion. At other times,
after a <i>razzia</i> or capture of property, the booty is divided
into four equal parts. They who execute the enterprise
form themselves into four sections, and each section
names a <i>mekadem</i> whose business it is to manage the
subdivision. The <i>mekadim</i> search out and demand the
restitution of all articles concealed by dishonourable
persons, such as jewelry, money, coral, etc. When an
<a id='Page_241'></a>Arab is suspected of having purloined things in this
manner, and nothing is found upon him, the <i>mekadim</i>
make him swear by Sidi-Ben-Abd-Allah, and that oath
clears him. In the Sahara, Sidi-Ben-Abd-Allah is held in
great veneration. No one would dare to invoke his
name falsely, through fear of dying, or of seeing his
flocks waste away. The <i>mekadim</i> are acknowledged to
be honest among pilferers. They are well treated and
receive a handsome remuneration, consisting for the
most parts of articles not included in the division of the
spoils.</p>

    <div>REMARKS BY THE EMIR ABD-EL-KADER.</div>

</div>

<p class='c009'>I have surprised them with horses of pure race, with
sleek coats, foreheads adorned with stars announcing
good fortune, flanks lean through exercise, and flesh
firm and hard. I have fallen upon them like a cloud
charged with lightning that hangs over a defile.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is a horse that, without ever being fatigued, always
finishes by asking pardon of his rider. His head is lean,
his ears and lips fine, his nostrils well open, his neck
slender, his skin black and soft, his coat sleek, and his
joints large. By the head of the Prophet! he is of noble
race, and you would never ask how much he cost if you
had seen him marching against the enemy.</p>

<p class='c009'>When you see the horses of the <i>goum</i> marching
proudly, their heads up, and making the air re-echo with
their neighings, rest assured that victory accompanies
them. But, on the other hand, when you see the
horses of the <i>goum</i> marching sadly, with their heads
<a id='Page_242'></a>down, without neighing, but lashing themselves with
their tails, be sure that fortune has abandoned them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nevertheless, Allah is wiser than man.</p>

  <a id='Page_243'></a>
  <h2 class='c004'>OSTRICH HUNTING.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>In the desert there are two principal modes of hunting
the ostrich—on horseback, and in ambush. There is,
indeed, a third method which is only a modification of
the second, and consists in killing the bird while drinking
at a stream of water.</p>

<p class='c009'>The true sport is on horseback. Watching for the
bird is no better than taking a sitting shot with us.
The former is a noble and royal pastime, the latter is
only fit for a common fellow, or a poacher. It is not
enough to kill, the thing is to run the bird down. For
this purpose the general sort of education given to a
horse will not suffice. A special preparation is required,
just as a race-horse needs a particular training for some
days previous to the contest.</p>

<p class='c009'>Seven or eight days before a hunting expedition, both
grass and straw are entirely stopped, and nothing but
barley given. The horse is watered only once a day, at
sunset, when the water begins to get cool, and he is
then washed all over. He is taken out for a long ride
every day, now walking, now galloping, during which
the rider carefully ascertains that nothing is wanting to
<a id='Page_244'></a>the equipment proper for the purpose. At the end of
these seven or eight days, say the Arabs, the belly disappears,
while the neck, chest, and croup show firm
flesh. The animal is then ready to endure the fatigue.
This special training is called <i>teshaha</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>The equipment also is modified with a view to lighten
the weight. The stirrups should be much less heavy
than usual, the saddle-bow very light, the two <i>kerbouss</i>,
or pommels, of less than the ordinary height and without
the <i>stara</i>. The breast-band is likewise omitted, and
instead of the seven pieces of felt only two are used.
The bridle, in like manner undergoes several metamorphoses.
The blinkers and headstall are omitted as too
heavy, the bit being simply fastened to a tolerably stout
camel-rope, without any throat-band, and kept in its
place by a make-shift headstall of cord. The reins are
also very light, but strong. All four feet are shod.</p>

<p class='c009'>The most favourable season for this sport is during the
great heats of summer. The higher the temperature,
the less energy does the ostrich possess to defend itself.
The Arabs describe the exact period by saying that it is
when a man, standing upright, casts a shadow no longer
than the sole of his foot. Ostrich hunting implies a
regular expedition lasting over seven or eight days. It
requires preparatory arrangements which are concerted
by ten or a dozen horsemen bound in "a knot," as for a
<i>razzia</i>. Each hunter is accompanied by a servant, called
a <i>zemmal</i>, who is mounted on a camel that carries,
besides, four goat-skin bags filled with water, barley for
the horse, wheaten flour, another kind of flour parched,
dates, a pot to boil the food in, leather thongs, a needle,
and a set of horse-shoes and nails.</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='Page_245'></a>Each hunter should take only one woollen or cotton
shirt, and one pair of woollen trousers. He winds round
his neck and ears a kind of thin stuff called in the desert
<i>haouli</i>, and fastens it with his camel-rope. His feet are
protected by sandals attached by cords, but he also puts
on light gaiters [<i>trabag</i>]. He takes neither rifle, nor
pistol, nor powder. His only weapon is a club of wild
olive or tamarisk, four or five feet long and terminating
in a very heavy knob. The party do not start until they
have ascertained from travellers, or caravans, or from
messengers sent forward for that purpose, where a
large number of ostriches are collected at one point.
These birds are generally met with in places where there
is a good deal of grass, and where rain has recently
fallen. According to the Arabs, whenever the ostrich
sees the lightnings flash and a thunder storm coming on,
it immediately hastens in that direction, however distant
it may be, for it thinks nothing of going ten days
on the stretch. In the desert it is proverbially said of a
man who is particularly careful in tending his flocks and
supplying them with what is necessary, that "he is like
the ostrich—where he sees the lightning flash, he is
there."</p>

<p class='c009'>The start is made in the morning. At the end of one
or two days' march, when the hunters have arrived near
to the spot where they were told to look for ostriches,
and where tracks are observable, they halt and bivouac.
On the morrow two intelligent servants, stripped to the
skin, and wearing nothing but a handkerchief round
their loins, are sent forward to reconnoitre. They take
with them a goat's-skin bag suspended from the side,
and a small quantity of bread, and walk on until they
<a id='Page_246'></a>come upon the ostriches, which usually keep to the
high ground. As soon as they have sighted them, they
lie down and observe their movements; and then, while
one remains, the other returns to the camp, and says
that he has seen thirty, forty, sixty ostriches—it is
alleged that <i>djeliba</i> or troops to that number are really
to be met with. At certain times, and especially when
mating, the ostriches are seldom found more than three
or four couples together.</p>

<p class='c009'>Guided by the man who has brought the information,
the hunters advance cautiously in the direction of the
ostriches, and on nearing the hillock on which the birds
were sighted, they use every precaution to avoid being
seen. Having at length reached the last inequality of
ground that affords them any sort of cover, they dismount,
and two scouts crawl forward to make sure that
the birds are still in the same place. If these bring
confirmation of the former tidings, each rider gives his
horse a small draught of the water brought on a camel's
back, for it is rare to find a place where water is to be
had. The baggage is piled up where the halt takes place,
without any one being left to watch it, so certain are
they of being able to retrace their steps to the identical
spot. Every hunter is provided with a <i>chibouta</i>, or
goat's-skin bag of water. The attendants follow the
tracks of the horses—the camel carrying only the
horses' evening feed of barley and his own, and water
for both men and animals.</p>

<p class='c009'>Carefully reconnoitring the ground occupied by the
ostriches, the hunters concert their mode of attack.
Spreading out, they gradually form a circle, in which
they inclose the quarry at a sufficient distance not to be
<a id='Page_247'></a>seen, for the ostrich is very far-sighted. The attendants
fill up the gaps between the horsemen. Then, when all
are at their respective posts, the latter advance straight
upon the ostriches, who flee panic-stricken, but are met
by the horsemen, who at first content themselves by
driving them back within the circle. The ostrich thus
exhausts its strength by the rapidity of its movements;
for, when surprised, it does not "husband its wind."
Again and again it repeats the same manœuvre, always
trying to break through the circle and always driven
back in affright. At the first symptoms of fatigue, the
hunters dash at them, and presently the troop scatters
in all directions. Those that are losing strength open
out their wings, which is a sure sign of weariness. The
hunters, now secure of their prey, hold in their horses.
Each one picks out a bird, rides after it, overtakes it,
and, either from behind or from the side, fetches it a
terrible blow on the head with the cudgel already mentioned.
The head is bald and very sensitive, whereas
other parts of the body would offer greater resistance.
Stunned with the blow, the ostrich falls to the ground,
and the hunter, springing out of his saddle, cuts its
throat, taking care, however, to hold it away from the
body, so that the wings may not be stained with the
blood.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <i>delim</i>, or male bird, when its throat is cut, especially
if near its young ones, moans in a lamentable
manner, but the <i>reumda</i>, or female, utters not a sound.
When the ostrich is on the point of being overtaken, it is
so exhausted that, if the hunter is willing to spare its life,
it is easy for him to lead it away captive, guiding it with
his cudgel; for by that time it can scarcely walk.
<a id='Page_248'></a>Immediately after being bled, the bird is carefully skinned,
so as not to spoil the feathers, and the skin is
stretched on a tree or on a horse. When the camels
arrive, salt is plentifully rubbed in.</p>

<p class='c009'>The servants now light fires and prepare the pots, in
which they boil for a long time over a fierce fire all the
fat of the bird. As soon as it is reduced to a very liquid
state, it is poured into a sort of leather bottle formed of
the skin stripped off from the thigh to the foot, and
strongly tied at the lower end; it would spoil if put into
skin taken from any other part of the body. The fat
of an ostrich in good condition ought to fill both its
legs. When the bird is brooding, it is very lean, and at
that time its fat would certainly not fill both legs; and it
is, at that time, hunted only for the sake of its feathers.
The rest of the flesh is served up for the hunters' supper,
seasoned with flour and pepper.</p>

<p class='c009'>The attendants having watered the horses and given
them a feed of barley, and the hunters having refreshed
themselves, they hasten, no matter how fatiguing the
chace may have been, to return to the spot where they
left their baggage. There they remain forty eight hours
to rest their horses, on whom they bestow the greatest
care. After that, they regain their tents. Sometimes
they send the produce of the chace to the <i>douar</i>, whence
the servants bring back a fresh supply of provisions, and,
on receiving favourable intelligence, they start on a new
expedition.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the desert, the male bird is called <i>delim</i>; the female,
<i>reumda</i>; a one-year old, <i>ral</i>; over one year, <i>oulid gleub</i>;
a two-year old, <i>oulid bou gleubtin</i>; a three-year old, <i>garah</i>,
at which age the bird attains its full growth.</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='Page_249'></a>The fat of the ostrich is used in the preparation of
food—of kouskoussou, for instance—and it is likewise
eaten with bread. The Arabs also apply it as a remedy
in many diseases. It is sold in the market-place, and in
the tents of the rich a store of it is often kept to give
away to the poor, as a medicine. It is not, however, by
any means expensive—one pot of ostrich grease being
exchanged for only three pots of butter.</p>

<p class='c009'>The plumes are sold in the <i>kuesours</i>, at Tougourt and
at Leghrouât, and among the Beni-Mzab, who, at the
time of the purchase of grain, bring ostrich skins down
to the seaboard. Among the Oulad-Sidi-Shikh the skin
of the male was formerly sold at from four to five <i>douros</i>,
and that of the female at from ten to fifteen francs; but
of late the price has risen considerably. In the Sahara,
before our time, the beautiful ostrich plumes were only
used to ornament the top of a tent or a straw hat. The
Shamba strengthen their shoes with the skin of the
under part of an ostrich's foot. They place a strip under
the toes, and another under the heel, and the sole will
thus wear a long time. With the sinews they make
laces to sow the saddles, and to mend various articles
made of leather.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the eyes of the Arab ostrich hunting possesses the
double charm of profit and pleasure. It is a favourite
exercise of the horsemen of the Sahara, and it is also a
remunerative enterprise, the value of the skin and fat
much more than covering the expense. Notwithstanding
the numerous train indispensable for this species of
sport, it is not by any means the exclusive privilege of
the rich. Any poor man who feels that he can acquit
himself well can generally contrive to join a party of
<a id='Page_250'></a>horsemen who propose to hunt the ostrich. He goes
to a wealthy Arab, who lends him a camel, a horse and
harness, and two-thirds of the barley required, two-thirds
of the goat-skins, and two-thirds of the supply of food.
The other third of all things is provided by the borrower,
and the produce of the chace is divided between the two
in the same proportions. The servant who, during the
expedition, rides the camel lent to the poor man,
receives from the latter two <i>boudjous</i> for every male
killed, and one <i>boudjou</i> for every female. He is, besides,
fed from the provisions taken with him by the horseman.</p>

<p class='c009'>The ostrich is also hunted by lying in ambush, after
it has laid its eggs, or towards the middle of November.
Five or six horsemen, taking with them a couple of
camels loaded with supplies for at least a month, go
in search of places where rain has recently fallen, or
where ponds are to be found. In such localities there is
certain to be abundance of herbage, which never fails
to attract the ostriches in considerable numbers. To
avoid idle wanderings to and fro, they question every
individual, every caravan, they happen to meet: besides,
they know beforehand the most likely stations. On
these occasions they provide themselves, not with a
cudgel, but with a rifle and an ample supply of powder
and ball.</p>

<p class='c009'>As soon as they come upon ostrich tracks, the hunters
examine them closely. If they appear only in the form
of patches here and there eaten down to the ground, it
shows that the ostrich has come here merely to graze.
But if the tracks cross each other in all directions, if the
grass has been trampled under foot, but not eaten, it is a
sure sign that the ostrich has made her nest in the
<a id='Page_251'></a>neighbourhood. The hunters thereupon search attentively
for the spot where she has deposited her eggs, and
approach it with the greatest precautions. While the
ostrich is digging out her nest, all day long her plaintive
moanings may be heard, but after her eggs are laid she
never utters her usual cry until about three in the
afternoon.</p>

<p class='c009'>The female sits on her eggs from morning till mid-day,
while the male goes to the pasture. At noon he returns,
and the female goes to feed in her turn. When she
comes back, she places herself four or five paces from
the nest, in front of the male, who incubates all night.
The male himself keeps watch over the eggs to defend
them from all enemies. Jackals, among others, often
times place themselves in ambush near at hand ready to
play them an evil turn, and their bodies have frequently
been found by the hunters lying not far from the nests,
stricken to death by the male—the female being too
timid to inspire any fear.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is in the morning, during the time the female is
sitting, that the hunters dig on each side of the nest,
and not above twenty paces distant, a hole deep enough
to contain a man. They then cover it over with the
long grass so common in the desert, so that only his rifle
is seen. The best marksmen are, of course, placed in
these holes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Seeing all these preparations, the female takes fright,
and runs off to join the male, who beats her and compels
her to return to the nest. If these preparations were to
be made while the male is brooding, he would go off to
join the female, and neither of them would ever come
back again.</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='Page_252'></a>When the female returns to the nest, they take care
not to molest her, it being the rule to kill the male in
the first instance. It is, therefore, customary to await
his return from the pasture, which happens about noon,
when the hunter holds himself ready. The ostrich,
while engaged in incubation, spreads out its wings so
as to cover all the eggs. In this position, with its legs
bent under the body, the thighs are very conspicuous.
This circumstance is favourable to the marksman who
aims to break the leg of the bird. All chance of escape
is thus cut away, which would not be the case were it is
wounded in any other part. As soon as the ostrich is
down the hunters run up and cut its throat. The two
marksmen come out of their holes, and their companions,
attracted by the report, lend their assistance. All traces
of blood are quickly covered with sand, and the body of
the bird carefully concealed. At sunset the female
returns as usual to pass the night close to the nest.
The absence of the male causes her no anxiety, for she
fancies he has merely gone away to feed, and she
quietly sits upon the eggs. She is then killed in the
same manner as her mate, by the hunter who has not
previously fired. The one who shot the male receives a
<i>douro</i> in addition to his proper share; but if, what
rarely happens, he should miss his aim, he pays to his
companions the value of the bird: "We chose thee,"
they say, "as the best shot: we placed thee in the good
position to do us a benefit, and lo! thou workest us such
a wrong as this. Thou shalt pay for it." The hunter
who killed the female receives only an egg over and
above his share. If he miss, he forfeits what would have
come to him from the price of the male and the eggs.
<a id='Page_253'></a>The one who is to fire at the male is appointed beforehand.</p>

<p class='c009'>The nest of an ordinary couple contains from twenty
five to thirty eggs, but it frequently happens that several
couples combine to lay in common. In that case, they
form a large enclosure, and the oldest couple are placed
in the centre, with the others around them in regular
order—so that, if they are four in number, they will
occupy the four angles of a square. When the eggs are
all laid they are pushed towards the centre, but not mingled
together; and when the oldest male comes to sit
the others take their places around, where their eggs
were laid—and the same with the females. These
companies are composed of the young of the same
family—in fact, of the young of the oldest couple. They
do not all lay the same number of eggs. The one-year
olds, for instance, do not lay more than four or five, and
those of a small size. At times as many as a hundred
eggs are found in the same nest. These family gatherings
are most common where the herbage is most
abundant. The Arabs have observed a very singular
circumstance. The eggs of each couple in these
monster nests are carefully piled up together, with one
egg conspicuously at the top. It is the one first laid,
and it serves for a special purpose. As soon as the male
perceives that the moment has arrived for hatching, he
breaks with his beak the egg he judges to be the most
forward, and at the same time very carefully makes a
small hole in the one which surmounts the others. The
latter furnishes their first meal to all the young ones as
they are hatched, and, though open, will remain sweet
for a considerable time. This quality is peculiarly
<a id='Page_254'></a>useful; for the male does not break all the eggs on the
same day, but only three or four at a time, when he hears
the young ones moving inside. The egg which supplies
them with nourishment is always liquid, whether
through the prevision of nature, or that the old birds
have instinctively avoided sitting on it.</p>

<p class='c009'>The fledglings, after having partaken of their first
meal, and being speedily dried in the sun, begin at once
to run about, and at the end of a few days follow the
parent birds to the pasture: in the nest, they always
nestle under their wings. The nest is generally of a
circular form, and is formed in a sandy soil. The ostrich
constructs it with its feet, by simply throwing out the
sand from the centre to the circumference. The dust
raised by this operation may be seen at some distance.
The period of incubation lasts ninety nights.</p>

<p class='c009'>The hunters eat the eggs if they are fresh, and not
near ready to be hatched. The shells they either throw
away, or take with them, to give as presents to friends,
or to deposit them in the <i>koubba</i>.<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c011'><sup>[85]</sup></a> However, for some
time past, the Arabs have become aware that eggs are
an article of traffic on the seaboard, and they now reserve
them for that object.</p>

<p class='c009'>The ambush hunt is very lucrative. It is quite possible
to kill several birds and carry off their eggs. At
that season, the ostrich itself is very lean; but, on the
other hand, the feathers are better and hold more firmly
together. Where several couples are assembled together
in one nest, it is only the oldest male and female that
are killed. Were the hunters to make as many holes as
<a id='Page_255'></a>there are birds, they would very soon be discovered, and
the whole company would take to flight.</p>

<p class='c009'>According to the Arabs, ostriches kill vipers with a
stroke of their beak, and swallow them. They eat, also,
serpents, locusts, scorpions, lizards, and a very large
fruit called <i>hadj</i>, abundant in the desert, and produced
by a creeping plant, bitter as turpentine, having leaves
like those of a water-melon: in short, they digest anything,
even stones. Such is the voracity of this bird
that where it is kept in a domesticated state, it bolts
everything it comes across, knives, jewelry, bits of iron.
The Arab who gave me these details declared that a
woman one day had a coral necklace snatched from her
neck and swallowed by an ostrich, and I have heard an
officer of the African army relate how one tore off and
bolted a button from his tunic. It is at the same time
very adroit, and will snatch a date from a man's lips
without hurting him. When lightnings flash and announce
a coming storm, they cannot contain themselves
for joy. They jump about, and hasten towards the water
of which they are so fond, though capable of long endurance
of thirst.</p>

<p class='c009'>Paternal love is a strong passion in the male ostrich.
He never deserts his young, and fears no danger, be it
what it may, whether from dogs, hyænas, or man himself.
The female, on the contrary, is easily frightened,
and forsakes all in her terror. Thus, in speaking of a
man who defends his tent with courage, they compare
him to the <i>delim</i>; while a feeble, timid man is likened
to the <i>reumda</i>. Ostriches are generally met travelling
together in couples, or in family parties of four or five
couples. But, where rain has fallen, one is certain to
<a id='Page_256'></a>find two or three hundreds of these birds together. From
a distance, they resemble a flock of camels. They never
approach a spot that is inhabited except to drink, after
which they flee away in haste.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Arabs hunt the young of the ostrich by a very
simple method. Once upon the track, and at a short
distance from the birds, they begin to shout aloud. The
young ones, being frightened, run for protection to the
parent birds; and the hunters, coming up with them,
seize upon their prey in spite of the male, and under his
very eyes. The <i>delim</i> becomes terribly excited, and
exhibits the most poignant grief. Sometimes greyhounds
are employed in this sport. While the old birds
are defending themselves against the dogs, the hunters
carry off the little ones without any difficulty, and
bring them up in their tents, where they are easily
tamed. They play with the children and sleep under
the canvass. In the wanderings of the tribe they follow
the camels. There is no instance of any bird brought
up in this way taking to flight. They are full of spirits,
and frolic with the horsemen, dogs, etc., etc. Does a
hare happen to start up, away go the men in full chace,
and the ostrich, becoming excited, rushes after them
and takes part in the hunt. If it meets in the <i>douar</i> a
child with something in its hand of an eatable nature,
it lays him gently on the ground, and endeavours to
take it from him. The ostrich is a great thief; or rather,
as I have already said, it desires to swallow everything
it sees. The Arabs, therefore, distrust it when they are
counting out money, for two or three <i>douros</i> would soon
disappear.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is no uncommon thing to see a wearied child placed
<a id='Page_257'></a>on the back of an ostrich. The bird proceeds with its
burden straight to the tent, the little fellow holding on
by its pinions. But it would not submit to carry a
heavier load—a man, for example, but would hurl him
to the ground by a blow from its wing. On the march,
in order to keep it from running about to the right or
left, they pass a cord round one of its hocks, to which
they fasten another cord by which to hold it. In the
desert, the ostrich has no other enemy to fear than man.
It can repel the dog, the jackal, the hyæna, and the
eagle, but yields, perforce, to man.</p>

<p class='c009'>I mentioned that there was a third mode of hunting
the ostrich, when on its way to water. The Arabs
simply make a hole near the water, conceal themselves
in it, and fire upon the creature as it approaches to
drink.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ostrich hunting, in the Sahara, makes numerous and
excellent marksmen, who practice at hitting nothing
but the head, in order that the blood may not stain
the feathers. A marksman of note always carries a
chaplet of talismans behind the lock of his rifle, and his
name is quoted in the tribes. Among the defenders
of Zaatcha there was more than one crack hunter of
ostriches.</p>

<p class='c009'>The ostrich drinks every fifth day if water is to be
had: if not, it can endure thirst for a long time. Ostrich
hunting is a very profitable sport. The Arabs say of a
successful speculation: "It is an excellent transaction—as
good as an ostrich hunt."</p>

<p class='c009'>The Arab to whom I am indebted for these particulars
is an Oulad-Sidi-Shikh, named Abd-el-Kader-Mohammed-ben-Kaddour,
a professional hunter. According to him,
<a id='Page_258'></a>the country for ostriches is comprised in a triangle
contained by lines drawn from Insalah to Figuig, from
South to North—from Figuig to Sidi-Okba, from West
to East—and from Sidi-Okba to Ouargla, from North to
South.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>GAZELLE HUNTING.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>The chace of the gazelle is not, like that of the ostrich,
at the same time a lucrative and a toilsome enterprise—it
is merely an exercise, a pastime, a party of pleasure.
The gazelle is barely worth a franc or a franc and a half,
and it is not for such a valueless prey that an Arab will
prepare, train, fatigue, and even risk the loss of a horse,—as
frequently happens in ostrich hunting. Besides,
in this species of sport, the chief credit belongs neither
to the man nor to the horse,—for whom it is, properly
speaking, nothing more than a promenade—but to the
greyhound, that other companion of the noble of the
desert, of whom I shall have occasion to speak hereafter.</p>

<p class='c009'>If the gazelle be of little value, it is because it is by no
means rare. Everywhere, but above all in Sersou, is
found the <i>sine</i>, or diminutive gazelle; in the Tell and in
mountainous districts, the <i>ademi</i>, the largest kind; and
in the Sahara, the <i>rime</i>, or intermediate species,
distinguished by the whiteness of its belly and thighs, and the
length of its horns. All these varieties alike travel in
herds of four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, a hundred; and
not unfrequently as many as two or three hundred are
<a id='Page_260'></a>found herding together. At a distance they may be
taken for the flocks of an emigrating tribe. A herd of
gazelles is called a <i>djeliba</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gazelle hunting is not a sport exclusively reserved for
horsemen. In the incessant and daily wanderings of
the Sahara tribes, as soon as the camp is fixed near a
fountain or river, the hunters set off in great numbers,
taking care to go up the wind. The gazelles possessing
a very fine sense of smell, the scent of the men wafted
on the wind would soon put them to flight. The hunter
advances under shelter of bush after bush, and from
time to time imitates the cry of the gazelle. The latter
stops, looks about on all sides, and seeks the companion
it supposes to have gone astray. The hunter approaches
close to it, and may even be seen without scaring it
away. At a proper distance he pulls the trigger, and
rarely misses his aim, "unless a spell cast upon his rifle
causes it to hang fire, and prevents it from going off
during the whole day." At the sound of the report the
entire herd dashes off at top speed, but at the end of a
league or a league and a half, their fright has passed off
with the recollection of the cause of their alarm, and
they again halt and go on browsing as before.</p>

<p class='c009'>The genuine hunter is a hardy, indefatigable walker.
Experience teaches him in what direction the herd is
likely to stop, and to that he bends his steps. Again he
conceals himself and repeats the former manœuvre. In
this manner, in the course of the day, he can bring down
three or four gazelles, which his friends or servants will
lift up and carry to the camp in triumph. In the spring
time, when the <i>djedi</i>, or fawns, sleep amidst the <i>alfa</i>,
having taken their fill of the milk of their mother, it is
<a id='Page_261'></a>easy to catch a dozen or fifteen of them in a single
morning. It is the old hind that generally betrays them.</p>

<p class='c009'>But not such is the sport of persons of distinction, of the
real horsemen. What the great chiefs affect is to hunt
them on horseback. A dozen or fifteen cavaliers take the
field, accompanied by their servants, and seven or eight
greyhounds, and carrying with them tents and provisions.
Directing their course towards a place where
gazelles are usually found, they ride forward at a venture.
When a herd of gazelles appears in the distance, they
proceed towards it, covering their advance as much as
possible by means of shrubs and the inequalities of the
ground. When they get within a quarter of a league, the
attendants who hold the hounds in leash, squeezing their
throats to prevent them from giving tongue, dismount
and let them slip. No sooner do they find themselves
free than they go off like an arrow, the Arabs stimulating
them to still greater speed by shouts and passionate
invocations: "My brother! my lord! my friend! there
they are!" The horsemen follow leisurely at a gentle
gallop, so as not to be quite thrown out; and behind them
comes the baggage. The best greyhounds will not fairly
overtake the herd until after a course of two or three
leagues. Then, at last, the spectacle becomes full of
incident and interest. A thoroughbred greyhound picks
out the finest animal of the herd, and springs forward.
A contest of agility and swiftness ensues. The gazelle
doubles, now to the right, now to the left, bounds forwards
and backwards, leaps even over the greyhound,
and strives sometimes to throw him out, sometimes to
strike him with its horns. Its windings and doublings
are all to no purpose. Ardent and indefatigable, its
<a id='Page_262'></a>enemy hangs close upon its track. When on the point
of being pulled down it utters plaintive cries, and chants,
as it were, its death song—song of death to it, but of
victory to the greyhound who seizes it by the back of
the neck, and snaps the vertebral column with its teeth.
The gazelle falls to the ground, and lies motionless at
the feet of the victor, until the hunters come up and cut
the throat of the still living animal.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now, as every true Believer should conform to the
Law, and as it is possible that he may not reach the spot
for a quarter of an hour after the gazelle has been pulled
down, the hunters, before letting the hounds loose, do
not omit to exclaim: <i>Bi es-sem Allah! Allah akbar!</i>
"In the name of Allah! Allah is great!" For the
Prophet hath said: "When thou hast let loose thy dog
and hast invoked the name of Allah, if thy dog has
not killed the game that he has overtaken, and thou
hast found it yet alive, cut its throat to purify<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c011'><sup>[86]</sup></a> it; and
if it was already dead when thou hast found it, and thy
dog has not eaten of it, thou mayest eat of it." If the
previous invocation was omitted through accident, the
game may still be eaten; but not if the omission has
been voluntary.</p>

<p class='c009'>The horsemen who are well mounted, and own the best
greyhounds, renew the chace, and not until the evening
do men and animals take rest. Sometimes the hunters
cook the gazelle on the spot where they have pitched
their camp. At other times, on their return home on the
morrow, they send the product of the chace to their
friends and relatives, and these presents give rise to
<a id='Page_263'></a>family feastings at which the chief dish consists of the
flesh of this animal, so highly esteemed by the Arabs.
Gazelles are brought up in the tents, and are driven with
the sheep at every change of encampment; but in the
end they always contrive to escape. The winter is the
proper season for hunting the gazelle and the antelope.
The earth, softened by the heavy rains, retards and embarrasses
their flight, while the dogs and horses find
water everywhere. When the snow is on the ground, if
a party of Arabs come upon a herd of gazelles, a regular
massacre ensues. They are then unable to run, and
being famished are easily overtaken. Ten or a dozen
may be killed by each Arab. In hunting this animal
the Arabs take with them three burnouses, boots, and
shoes, and carry the horse-cloth upon the top of the
saddle.</p>

<p class='c009'>The proverbial beauty of the gazelle's eyes, and the
whiteness of its teeth, have given rise to a curious
practice. Women with child have one brought to them
that they may lick its eyes with their tongue, in the
belief that the eyes of their infant will have the same
lustrous melancholy. Under a similar idea they touch
its teeth with a finger, which they afterwards put into
their own mouth. The horns, shaved thin and mounted
in silver, are used by women as instruments to put <i>kohol</i>
on their eyes; and the skin, after being carefully tanned,
is made into <i>mezoueud</i>, or cushions, in which they
enclose their most valuable articles.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <a id='Page_264'></a>
  <h2 class='c004'>THE GREYHOUND.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>If it were necessary to prove how aristocratic are the
habits of the people of the Sahara, how lordly their
tastes, I could give yet another very simple proof, which
some persons may regard as puerile—I mean the love
they have for the <i>slougui</i>, or greyhound.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the Sahara, as in all Arab countries, the dog is
looked upon as a servant in disgrace, troublesome, and
cast off, no matter how useful he may be in guarding the
<i>douar</i>, or in looking after the flocks. The greyhound
alone enjoys the esteem, the consideration, the tender
attention of his master. The rich as well as the poor
regard him as a companion of their chivalrous pastimes;
while for the latter he is also the purveyor that supplies
them with food. They do not grudge him, therefore,
the most assiduous care. The couplings are as scrupulously
superintended as those of their horses. A
Saharene will go twenty or thirty leagues to couple a
handsome greyhound bitch with a dog of established
reputation; for one that is really famous will run down
a gazelle. "When he perceives a gazelle cropping a
blade of grass, he overtakes her before she has time to
<a id='Page_265'></a>swallow what she already holds in her mouth." This
is an hyperbolical expression, no doubt, but still it is
based on a certain degree of truth.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the <i>slouguïa</i>, or bitch, has pupped, the litter is
never lost sight of for an instant. The women will
sometimes give their own milk to them. Visitors arrive
in troops, the more numerous and eager according to
the reputation of the mother. They surround the owner,
offering him dates, kouskoussou, etc. There is no sort
of flattery they will not lavish upon him in the hope of
obtaining a pup: "I am thy friend. Prithee, give me
what I ask of thee. I will attend thee in thy hunts," etc.
To all these solicitations, the owner usually replies that
he will not decide upon what pups he means to keep for
himself until after seven days. This reservation has its
motive in a very singular observation, or fancy, of the
Arabs: in every litter, one of the pups gets upon the
back of the others. Is it a sign of greater vigour? or is
it mere chance? To ascertain this point they remove it
from its habitual position, and if it returns to it for seven
consecutive days, the owner builds upon it such extravagant
expectations, that he would not accept a negress
in exchange. A prejudice causes them to attach the
greatest value to the first, third, and fifth pups, in fact,
to all the odd numbers.</p>

<p class='c009'>The pups are weaned at the end of forty days, but are
still fed with goat's, or camel's milk, thickened with
dates, or kouskoussou. In the Sahara, the flocks are so
numerous and milk so abundant, that it is not at all surprising
that wealthy Arabs, after having weaned their
greyhound pups, should set aside so many she-goats for
their nourishment. When the pups are three or four
<a id='Page_266'></a>months old, their education commences. The boys drive
out of their holes the jerboa, or the rat called <i>boualal</i>,
and set the pups at them. The latter by degrees get
excited, dash after them at full speed, bark furiously at
their holes, and only give up the pursuit to begin
another. At the age of five or six months, they are
assigned a prey more difficult to catch—the hare. Men
on foot lead the greyhound close to the form where the
animal is couched. Then, by a slight exclamation, they
set the young dog, who rushes at the hare, and soon
acquires the habit of coursing with speed and intelligence.
From the hare, they pass to the young of the
gazelle. The Arabs approach the spot where these are
lying near their mother, and direct the attention of the
greyhound to them. As soon as he is thoroughly excited
and rears up with impatience, they let him go. After a
few lessons of this kind, the greyhound understands
perfectly what to do, and begins to press forward resolutely
in chace of the old hinds themselves.</p>

<p class='c009'>When a year old the greyhound has very nearly
reached its full strength. His scent is developed, and
he follows the gazelle by its slot. Nevertheless, he is
kept under some restraint, and not until the age of
fifteen to eighteen months is he regularly allowed to
hunt. From that period, however, he is held in leash,
and often with great difficulty; for the Arabs say that
when the greyhound scents the game, his muscular
power becomes so great that, if he stiffens himself upon
his paws, a man can hardly make him lift a leg. As
soon as he sights a herd of thirty or forty gazelles, he
trembles with joy, and looks up at his master, who cries
to him: "Ah son of a Jew! thou canst not say this time
<a id='Page_267'></a>that thou didst not see them." The hunter then takes
off his goat's-skin bag, and pours a little water on the
back and belly of the hound, who, in his impatience,
casts a suppliant eye on his master. At last, he is free
and bounds forward. Presently, he tries to hide himself,
stoops down, and follows a circuitous course until he is
within an easy distance, when he springs forward with
all his might, and picks out for his victim the finest male
in the herd. When the hunter cuts up the gazelle, he
throws to the <i>slougui</i> the flesh around the kidneys. If
he were to offer him the intestines, he would reject them
with disdain.</p>

<p class='c009'>The greyhound that cannot hunt at two years old, will
never be able do so. There is a saying to this effect,</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>A greyhound after two years</div>
    <div>And a man after two fasts [fifteen years];</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>meaning thereby that that is the proper age to judge
what either will ever be worth.</p>

<p class='c009'>The greyhound is an intelligent animal and full of self-love.
If, in slipping him, a fine gazelle is pointed out to
him, and he kills only a common looking one, he is very
sensible of the reproaches addressed to him, and slinks
off, ashamed of himself, without claiming his portion.
He has no lack of vanity, and indulges much in fantasia.
A thoroughbred <i>slougui</i> will neither eat nor drink from
a dirty vessel, and refuses milk in which the hand has
been dipped. Has he not been taught this disdainful
daintiness? And yet the utmost that is done for the
common dog, their faithful and vigilant guardian, is to
let him find his food among the offal and bones that are
lying about. And while the latter is driven with hootings
<a id='Page_268'></a>from tent and table, the greyhound sleeps in the
compartment reserved for men, on carpets by his
master's side, or on his very bed. He is clothed and
sheltered from the cold, like the horse, and is even
preferred for being chilly, as that is an additional proof
of the purity of his race. The women take pleasure in
bedecking him with ornaments, in tying collars of shells
round his neck, and in securing him from the evil eye
by fastening talismans on him. He is fed with care,
nicety, and caution, kouskoussou being lavished upon
him. In summer-time, to give him strength, they make
a paste of milk and dates, of which the stones have been
extracted. There are some who never feed their greyhounds
during the day. Nor is this all. The <i>slougui</i>
accompanies his master when on a visit, and receives
the same hospitality with him, having a portion of every
dish.</p>

<p class='c009'>A thoroughbred greyhound will hunt with no one but
his master. By his cleanliness, his respect for decency
and the graciousness of his manner, he shows that he
recognizes the attention paid to him. On his master's
return after a somewhat prolonged absence, the <i>slougui</i>
leaps with a bound on to his saddle, and caresses him.
The Arabs talk to him: "O friend, listen to me! You
must bring me some meat. I am tired of eating dates,"
and flatter him in many ways. The petted animal leaps
about in a frolicsome manner, and seems not only to
understand but to wish to reply. The death of a <i>slougui</i>
fills the whole tent with mourning, the women and
children bewailing him as if he were one of the family.
Sometimes it falls to the greyhound to find food for all,
and one that nourishes a family can never be for sale.
<a id='Page_269'></a>Now and then, however, he may be given away in
compliance with the supplications of women and relatives,
or of the most respected marabouts.</p>

<p class='c009'>A greyhound that catches with ease the <i>sine</i> and the
<i>ademi</i>, is worth a she-camel; but one that can overtake
the <i>rime</i> is priced as a valuable horse. They are very
generally named <i>ghezal</i> or <i>ghezala</i>, "a gazelle." Frequently
wagers are laid on such or such a <i>slougui</i>, the
stakes being sheep, or a feast of <i>taam</i>, dates, etc.</p>

<p class='c009'>The greyhound of the Sahara is far superior to that of
the Tell. He is of a tawny colour, and tall, with a
sharp snout, broad forehead, short ears, and muscular
neck; the muscles of the hindquarters being, also, very
prominent. He has no belly, clean limbs, well detached
sinews, the hock near the ground, the under part of the
paw small and dry, the palate and the tongue black, and
the hair very soft. Between the two ilia, there should
be the breadth of four fingers, and the tip of the tail
should be able to pass under the thigh and reach the
hip-bone. Both the fore-arms are generally fired in five
lines to harden the muscles.</p>

<p class='c009'>The most renowned greyhounds of the Sahara are
those of the Hamiân, the Oulad-Sidi-Shikh, the Harar,
the Arbâa, and the Oulad-Naïl.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <a id='Page_270'></a>
  <h2 class='c004'>HAWKING.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>The sporting equipments of a noble of the Sahara are
complete when he has a <i>thair el horr</i>, or a bird of race;
for there men of distinction are still addicted to falconry.
The <i>thair el horr</i> is of a dark yellow plumage, with a
short, powerful bill, thick, muscular thighs, and very
sharp talons. It is very rare, and is caught in the following
manner. When a <i>thair el horr</i> has been sighted,
they put a tame pigeon into a small net, and throw it up
into the air in front of the bird of prey, who swoops
down upon it. Her talons, however, get entangled in
the net, so that she can neither draw them out, nor fly
away, and is thus easily secured. When the falcon finds
herself a prisoner, she shows no signs of fear or anger.
There is a saying in the desert which is often quoted in
seasons of calamity:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>A bird of race, when she is caught, never frets.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Rings are passed round her legs and she is fastened
to a small perch prepared for her in the tent. To
accustom her to the presence of men, they cover her head
with a hood, which allows only the beak to appear.
<a id='Page_271'></a>Her master unhoods her, gives her fresh meat, holds her
on his fist, and caresses and speaks to her as much as
possible before a numerous company, to accustom her
to noise. At the end of a month the bird knows her
master, and is thoroughly tamed. They then take a
leveret and tie it by one leg, the hawk also being held
fast by a very long "creance." They unhood her, and
let the leveret go before her eyes. As soon as the bird
sees it, she rises into the air, uttering cries. The
leveret stops and squats down, when the falcon swoops
and kills it with a blow of her talons. The owner runs
up, draws the leveret, and gives a portion to the bird.
This manœuvre is repeated until the falcon shows no
desire to fly away, which is known by her remaining
beside the animal she has killed. The falcon, naturally
disposed to seize her prey, is further looked upon as
trained, when she answers to the call before she has
pounced upon her quarry.</p>

<p class='c009'>Having arrived at this point, the bird may be taken
out to hunt. The owner mounts his horse and takes her
with him, hooded, and perched upon his head or his
shoulders. As soon as he sees a hare, he unhoods her
and excites her with his voice. The falcon soars into
the air, and swoops down suddenly with a sharp cry,
and kills the animal with a single blow; after which the
hood is immediately put on again. Sometimes the hare
is killed so far off that the hunter cannot bleed it in time,
according to the religious injunction; but this inconvenience
is obviated by his exclaiming, when he throws off
the bird, <i>Bi es-sem Allah! Allah akbar</i>—"in the name
of Allah! Allah is great!" If the falcon has devoured a
part of the game, the rest may be eaten by the hunter,
<a id='Page_272'></a>because the bird of prey has been trained to return to
her master when he calls her, and not to eat the game.
A bird of race will no more eat carrion than will an
eagle. She will kill hares, rabbits, the young of the
gazelle, the <i>habara</i>—a bird, they say, as big as a
bustard—pigeons, and turtle-doves.</p>

<p class='c009'>The principal tribes of the Sahara that practice hawking
are: in the province of Constantine, the Douaouda,
the Selmya, the Oulad-Moulat, the Oulad-ben-Aly, the
Sahari, the Oulad-Mahdi, the Oulad-Bou-Azid, the
Rahman, and the Oulad-Zid; in the province of Algiers,
the Bou-Aysh, the Oulad-Mokhtar, the Oulad-Yagoub,
the Oulad-Shayb, the Oulad-Ayad, the Mouidat, the
Zenakha, the Abadlya, the Oulad-Naïl; and in the
province of Oran, the Hassasna, the Rezayna, the Oulad-Mehalla,
the Beni-Mathar, the Derraga, the Harar, the
Angades, the Hamyân, the Oulad-Sidi-Shikh, and the
Oulad-Khelif; and the inhabitants of all the regions
where <i>alfa</i> grows in abundance. Hawking is also
pursued in the higher table-lands, on the borders of the
Sahara.</p>

    <div>REMARKS BY THE EMIR ABD-EL-KADER.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The Arabs recognize four species of birds of noble
race, which they employ in the chace. These are the
<i>berana</i>, the <i>terakel</i>, the <i>nebala</i>, and the <i>bahara</i>. The
<i>berana</i> and the <i>terakel</i> are the most esteemed; especially
the <i>terakel</i>, which is the largest—the female sometimes
attaining the size of an ordinary eagle. This species
has black wings, gray on the under side. The belly is
<a id='Page_273'></a>black and white, the tail black, as is also the head when
young, but gradually turning gray and then white as
the bird grows older. Its beak is very hard and sharp,
and its talons solid and vigorous. The <i>berana</i> is less
strong and somewhat smaller than the <i>terakel</i>. Its
wings are of a whitish gray, its breast white, its tail
gray and white, the latter predominating. The head is
of many hues, but there also white is the dominant colour.
The <i>bahara</i> is almost entirely black, with the
exception of a few whitish spots on the breast. "It is a
negro, and not worth much." In the <i>nebala</i>, gray predominates;
there are some white spots, however, on the
wings, and the feet are yellow. All these birds mew at
the end of summer.</p>

<p class='c009'>In certain districts, the following species are likewise
valued; the <i>shashin</i>, the <i>aogab</i>, the <i>meguernes</i>, and the
<i>baz</i>. The <i>baz</i> is the most courageous. Its plumage is of
a dark red, its eyes deep set, with arched eyelids, its
shoulders wide apart, its feathers soft, its breast broad,
its rump thick, its tail short, its thighs wide apart, its
legs white, and its feet broad. The heavier it feels on
the hand, the swifter it is on the wing. It is said that
its wind is bad.</p>

<p class='c009'>The bird of noble race is given away rather than sold;
whoever catches one takes it to the master of a large
tent, who makes him a present in return. It is in the
summer-time that they endeavour to procure these noble
birds, in order to have time to train them for the hawking
season, which is towards the end of autumn. They
go to work in the following manner.</p>

<p class='c009'>They envelope a pigeon in a sort of shirt made of
horse-hair and a quantity of wool. A horseman rides
<a id='Page_274'></a>about a desert place carrying this lure with him, and
when he sees a bird of race, throws it up into the air
and then hides himself. The falcon stoops and strikes
it, but her legs and talons become entangled in the
wool and hair, and her struggles only make her position
worse. At last, stupefied and exhausted, she finishes
by alighting, or rather by falling on the ground, when
the horseman issues from his hiding place and secures
her. A perch is prepared for her in the chief's own tent,
to which the bird is fastened by an elegant thong of
<i>filali</i>.<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c011'><sup>[87]</sup></a> It is needless to add that the greatest care is
taken to attach the jesses, so as not to hurt the bird, or
cause her unnecessary inconvenience. The master of
the tent feeds her with his own hands once a day, about
two in the afternoon. Her ordinary food is raw mutton,
very clean, and carefully cut up. She is not stinted as
to quantity, may eat to satiety, and is even expected to
improve in condition.</p>

<p class='c009'>By way of commencing her education, they proceed
in this manner. They show her a large piece of flesh,
and at the same time call to her three times, with a cry
that may be represented by the sound long drawn out of
"Ouye! ouye! ouye!" The bird throws herself upon the
meat, which is not given up to her, but which she fights
hard to get hold of. They draw it away slowly, still
showing it to her and teasing her, until she is quite
exhausted, when they give her several small morsels on
her perch. Up to that time, the falcon is kept scrupulously
within the tent, remaining hood-winked all day,
and also during the first few nights, until she is accustomed
to live with the women and children, the dogs
<a id='Page_275'></a>and other animals. This last point is difficult to manage,
and is never completely achieved.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the "gentle" bird has got thus far, when she is
used to accept her food upon the perch, in the manner
above described, the circle of her prison is extended.
She is fastened by the foot to a cord, or creance, of
camel's hair, soft and pliable, from fifty to sixty cubits
in length, which allows her to go abroad. Outside of
the tent, they repeat the lesson of calls to come and be
fed, cautiously feeling their way. The falcon is in this
manner tended a long time within the tent, going out
only to receive her food. When her master is quite sure
of having accustomed her to himself, he takes her with
him on his fist to a considerable distance, putting on
and off her hood several times, at different intervals. It
is not without difficulty, without many struggles, that
the bird accommodates herself to the scene abroad, but
by degrees she becomes used to that also.</p>

<p class='c009'>At this period, the last touch is given to her education,
by means of the same calls, the same alternations of
teasing and gratifying; but far from the tent and the
<i>douar</i>, without hood and without leash, her food is given
to her. As soon as she is gorged, the hood and leash
are replaced. After that, her master never moves a step
without her perched upon his fist. But this is not
enough. The bird is only tamed—she has yet to be
trained for the sport. Accordingly, they take a hare
and cut its throat, disclosing the gash by drawing back
the skin, so as to let the flesh appear. Then, inside the
tent, they take off the hood of the falcon, who springs
at the throat of the animal, and is allowed to worry it
for a time in order to get a taste for it; and a little later
<a id='Page_276'></a>they give her some of the flesh. This manœuvre is
repeated seven or eight days following, with a live hare,
whose ears the master keeps pulling to make it squeal,
while he himself utters the call "Ouye! Ouye!" The
falcon precipitates herself on the head of the animal and
fights for it, pecking out the eyes, and sometimes the
tongue. The hare is then opened, and some of the flesh
given to the bird. This exercise is repeated more or less
frequently, according to the bird's aptitude for learning.</p>

<p class='c009'>The hawking season is now at hand. The bird must
be put to the proof, to ascertain if she has profited by
these lessons so skilfully graduated, by this education so
laboriously inculcated, and so appropriate to her nature
and to the style of sport for which she is intended. They
go out, therefore, on horseback, taking the "gentle"
bird hood-winked, and proceed to an open plain, or a
vast plateau, having first provided themselves with five
or six live hares. Having reached the appointed spot
they take a hare and, having broken its four feet, let it
go within the scope of the bird's ken. Squeaking and
moaning it hobbles on as well as it can, when they
unhood the falcon, and throw her off—exclaiming <i>Bi es-sem
Allah! Allah akbar!</i> The <i>terakel</i>, impatient, soars
straight up toward the sky, and from a great height
swoops down upon the hare, which she kills, or stuns,
with a single blow with her tightly closed talons, as
with a fist. The hunters come up, bleed and open the
animal, and give the entrails, the liver, and the heart to
the bird, who devours them on the spot. After repeating
this lesson several days in succession, the training of
the bird is considered complete.</p>

<p class='c009'>This course of instruction has extended from summer
<a id='Page_277'></a>to near the end of autumn, which is the favourable season,
for the falcon only hunts well in cloudy and cold weather.
She cannot endure the glare of the sun, nor yet thirst or
heat. She would leave her master to go in search of
water, which she sees from afar, and would never return.
At that period, then, a party sets out after a light breakfast,
at about eleven in the morning, with the falcon on
the shoulder or on the fist. The only provisions they
take with them are camel's milk, dates, bread, and dried
grapes.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the sport does not begin until after a tolerably long
ride, towards three in the afternoon. The cavalcade is
usually a numerous one. Having reached a suitable
spot, they scatter about, beating the brushwood and
tufts of <i>alfa</i> in the hope of starting a hare, which they
drive towards the man who holds the falcon. As soon as
the quarry is sighted, the latter unhoods the bird, and
throws her off; pointing with his finger to the hare, and
exclaiming <i>Ha hou!</i> "there it is!" While her master is
pronouncing the sacramental <i>Bi es-sem Allah! Allah
akbar!</i> the bird is off, soars out of sight, keeping the
hare in view all the time with her piercing eye, and then
precipitates herself upon it, and strikes it, either on the
head or on the shoulder, one blow with her closed talons,
violent enough to stun, if not to kill it. The horsemen,
seeing the falcon stoop, gallop up from all quarters,
surround her, and generally find her engaged in picking
out the eyes of the hare. To make her let go, some one
draws out from below his burnous the skin of another
hare, and throws it down a little way off, when she
immediately pounces upon it. Her <i>curée</i>, or reward, is
not given to her until after their return to the <i>douar</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='Page_278'></a>It will be readily understood that, though the bird was
fed abundantly, and even to excess, during the time she
was being tamed, and taught to obey the call, she is kept
somewhat sparingly during the hawking season, to avoid
making her dull and depriving her of her full power, and
in order to make her a good hunter, that is, ardent and
alert.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is no uncommon thing with two or three falcons to
kill from ten to fifteen hares in a day. A large bird called
the <i>habara</i><a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c011'><sup>[88]</sup></a> is also hunted with the <i>thair el horr</i>, and in
this wise. The hunters ride on until they meet with
<i>habaras</i>, who generally go in couples, or in companies
of half a dozen and more. The falcon is on the fist. Her
hood is removed, and the birds are pointed out to her.
When thoroughly roused, she is thrown off with the
invocation, <i>Bi es-sem Allah</i>! She soars aloft, stoops
upon her quarry, strikes it on the head, and holds it in
the pitiless grasp of her talons in spite of the desperate
struggles of the victim, until the horsemen come up and
snatch it from her. One of them then bleeds it to death,
and gives the falcon her reward. The flesh of this bird
intoxicates the falcon, according to the Arabs, either
because of the perfumed vapour emanating from it, or
because she is proud of the capture of a <i>habara</i>, a
dainty fit to set before a Sultan. Thus, when she is
replaced on the shoulder, she struts and balances herself,
and executes her fantasia. If the <i>habara</i> attempts to
fly, the falcon soars, and both mount together, the latter
rising higher and higher till she is well above the other,
when she precipitates herself upon it like a thunder-bolt,
and breaks, first a wing, and then the sternum. They
<a id='Page_279'></a>fall together, tumbling over and over, but the falcon
always managing to keep uppermost and to hold her
victim beneath her, so that it alone may feel the shock
of this frightful fall.</p>

<p class='c009'>The "gentle" bird hunts, also, the <i>seroun</i>, the <i>hamma</i>,
and the <i>agad</i>. Some falcons will not hunt the <i>habara</i>.
They are never trained to hunt partridges, as it is feared
that, if they became accustomed to it, they would prefer
a feathered quarry to one with a skin. If a bird delays
to return to her master, a horseman, holding in his hand
the skin of a hare furnished with ears and feet, gallops
up towards her and throws this lure to her, at the same
time hooping "Ouye!": she generally answers to the
call. This interjection, if I may so express myself, is the
vocative of the bird of race. The falcon, when properly
trained, seldom betrays, that is, escapes from her master.
They are sometimes lost, however, by their passion for
a desert bird called <i>hamma</i>, which they pursue with fury.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <i>biaz</i>—such is the name of the falconer, the individual
whose special duty it is to tend and feed the falcon—sometimes
entertains a blind and fatal attachment for
his pupil. He will pet and pamper her to excess; and
although it is proverbially said that "vanity is her only
counsellor and sole motive of her actions," yet, if she be
not hungry, instead of hunting, she resumes her liberty.
A bird, however, must be exceedingly well trained and
even renowned, to be kept for more than one year. As a
rule, unless she has displayed an exceptional prowess,
she is turned loose at the end of the season, as another is
sure to be obtained before the time comes round again.
Birds that have been kept for three years are quoted as
something quite out of the common run.</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='Page_280'></a>When the <i>djouad</i>, or nobles, go out hawking, it is in
parties of five-and-twenty to thirty, without reckoning
their attendants, and wagers are often laid. For a
trained falcon, a camel is given, or a hundred <i>boudjous</i>,
and at times even a horse. The falcon is regarded as a
member of the family. She lives in the tent, and is the
object of the most constant attention. Some chiefs are
never to be seen without their falcon, which they carry
about with them everywhere. It is a sign of distinction
and of gentle birth to have marks of a falcon's muting
on one's burnous. In the Sahara, little or great, rich
or poor, all alike love and caress the "gentle" bird.</p>

<p class='c009'>"And how should it be otherwise?" said to me one day
a noble Arab; "we love pomp, splendour, and magnificence,
and one must be more or less than an Arab not
to feel joy and excitement at the sight of our warriors
returning from hawking. The chief rides on in front,
followed by many horsemen, and carrying two falcons,
one on his shoulder, the other on his fist, guarded by a
leather gauntlet. The hoods of these birds are enriched
with silk, morocco leather, gold, and small ostrich
plumes, while their jesses are embroidered and ornamented
with silver bells. The steeds neigh, the camels
are loaded with game, and their drivers murmur, in a
melancholy tone, one of those chaunts of love, or war,
which never fail to find the way to our hearts. Yes;
I swear by the head of the Prophet, next to a goum
taking the field, there is nothing so striking as the departure
or return of a hawking party. Thus, however
weary, exhausted, and out of breath one may be, sleep
is less refreshing than the hope and expectation of recommencing
on the morrow."</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>THE CHACE</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c000'>
    <div>BY ABD-EL-KADER.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It is related that an Arab Sheikh was seated in the
centre of a numerous group, when a man who had lost
his ass presented himself before him, and asked if any
one had seen the animal that had gone astray. The
Sheikh immediately turned to those around him, and
addressed them in these words:—"Is there any one here
to whom the pleasures of the chace are unknown? Who
has never pursued the game at the risk of life and limb,
if he fell from his horse? Who, without fear of tearing
his clothes or his skin, has not thrown himself into the
midst of brushwood bristling with thorns, in order to
overtake the wolf? Is there any one here who has never
experienced the happiness of again meeting, the despair
of leaving a woman who was dearly loved?"</p>

<p class='c009'>One of his hearers answered: "For my part, I have
never done, or experienced any of those things you
mention."</p>

<p class='c009'>Looking to the owner of the ass, the sheikh thus
spoke: "Behold the beast you were looking for! Lead
him away."</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='Page_282'></a>The Arabs, indeed, have a saying that "he who has
never hunted, nor loved, nor felt emotion at the sound
of music, nor prized the perfume of flowers, is not a
man, but an ass." With us, war is especially a contest
of agility and craft. Consequently the chace is the
highest of all pastimes, as the pursuit of savage animals
teaches how to pursue men. A poet has written the
following eulogy of that art:</p>

<p class='c009'>"The chace disengages the mind from the cares by
which it is harassed. It adds to the vigour of the
intelligence, brings joyfulness, dissipates chagrin, and
renders useless the science of the physicians by maintaining
perpetual health in the human body.</p>

<p class='c009'>"It forms good horsemen, for it teaches them to spring
quickly into their saddles, to alight promptly on the
ground, to rush a horse across rocks and precipices, to
clear stones and bushes at full gallop, to push on without
stopping, even though some part of the harness has
been lost or broken.</p>

<p class='c009'>"Every one who gives himself up to the chace, makes
progress day by day in courage, and learns to despise
accidents.</p>

<p class='c009'>"To fully enjoy his favourite diversion, he withdraws
from perverse people. He puts falsehood and calumny
to the rout, escapes from the corruption of vice, and
emancipates himself from those fatal influences which
tinge our beards with gray, and burden us, before our
time, with the weight of years.</p>

<p class='c009'>"Days spent in the chace are not counted among the
days of one's life."</p>

<p class='c009'>In the Sahara, the chace is the sole occupation of the
chiefs and rich people. When the rainy season sets in,
<a id='Page_283'></a>the inhabitants of that region transport themselves to
the shores of the small lakes formed by the rain; and, if
game get scarce at one spot, they open up a new scene
in their wandering life. A legend familiar to every Arab
shows with what force the passion for the chace may
seize upon the heart of an African.</p>

<p class='c009'>A man of distinction fired at a gazelle and missed it.
In a hasty moment, he took an oath that no food should
come near his mouth until he had eaten the animal's
liver. Twice again, he fired at the gazelle, and with no
better success, but not the less did he continue the pursuit
for the whole of that day. At nightfall his strength
gave way; but true to his oath, he refused to take any
nourishment. His servants, therefore, resumed the
chace, which lasted for three days more. At last the
gazelle was killed, and its liver brought to the dying
Arab, who touched it with its lips and yielded up his
last breath.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Arabs hunt both on foot, and on horseback. A
horseman who would chace the hare must take with him
a greyhound, which is called <i>slougui</i>, from Slouguïa, a
spot where they were originally produced from the coupling
of she-wolves with dogs. The male <i>slougui</i> lives
twenty years, the female twelve. Greyhounds that are
able to run a gazelle down are rare. Few of them will
give chace either to the hare or to the gazelle, even if
those animals pass close to them. Their customary
object of pursuit is the <i>bekeur-el-ouhash</i>, which they
generally catch by the ham and pull to the ground. It
is said that this animal, in trying to recover itself, falls
forward on its head and is killed. Sometimes, the <i>slougui</i>
seizes the <i>bekeur-el-ouhash</i> by the throat, and holds it until
<a id='Page_284'></a>the hunter comes up. Many Arabs hunt this beast on
horseback, and strike it from behind with a spear. It is
also on horseback that they generally hunt the gazelle,
which goes in herds. They select from among its companions
the animal they intend to bring down, and shoot
it without for a moment pulling up their horse, on which
they started at full speed. There is an Arab proverb:
"More forgetful than a gazelle." This pretty creature,
in fact, appears to have the giddy brains as well as the
soft, mysterious glance of woman. The gazelle, if
missed, runs a little way further on, and again stops,
without heeding the ball which, in another minute, will
again seek its life. Some Arabs hunt this animal with
the falcon, which is trained to strike at the eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is especially among the Arabs of the Eshoul country
that this variety of sport chiefly prevails. I have there
met with a small tribe, called the Es-Lib, who lived
entirely on the products of the chace. Their tents were
made of the skins of gazelles and of <i>bekeur-el-ouhash</i>;
and their clothing, for the most part, was nothing
but the skins of wolves. A member of this little tribe
of hunters told me that when he went out to hunt he
generally took with him an ass laden with salt. Each
time he knocked over a gazelle, he cut its throat, opened
the belly, and rubbed the entrails with salt, and then left
it to dry on a bush. After a while he retraced his steps,
and carried to his family all the animals that he had thus
prepared, for in that district there are no beasts of prey
to dispute with a hunter for his game. The Es-Lib are
so accustomed to feed upon flesh, that the children threw
away the biscuits I gave to them, never supposing that
they were good to eat.</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='Page_285'></a>The hunt in ambush is often practised against both
the male and female of the <i>bekeur-el-ouhash</i>. When the
great heats have dried up the ponds in the desert, a hole
is dug close to the springs whither they resort to drink,
and they meet with their death while in the act of
quenching their thirst. The chace that demands the
greatest intrepidity is that of the <i>lerouy</i>, an animal
resembling the gazelle, but larger, though without
attaining the size of the <i>bekeur-el-ouhash</i>. The <i>lerouy</i>,
which is likewise called the <i>tis-el-djebel</i>, or mountain
goat, frequents rocks and precipices, among which it
must be pursued on foot, amid a thousand perils. As
these animals have very little speed, any ordinary dog
can catch them easily if they descend into the plains.
But they have a singular peculiarity, as I am assured.
A <i>lerouy</i> closely pressed by hunters throws itself down
a precipice a hundred cubits deep, and falls on its head
without receiving any hurt. The age of the animal is
known by the knobs on its horns—each knob indicating
a year. Both the <i>lerouy</i> and the gazelle have two
incisor teeth, but they have not those situated between
the incisors and the canine teeth.</p>

<p class='c009'>If <i>lerouy</i> hunting be the glory of the pedestrian,
ostrich hunting is the glory of the horseman. In the
season of the sirocco, when a sort of burning sleep seems
to weigh down all nature, when it might be thought
that all animated beings must be condemned to repose,
the dauntless hunters mount on horseback. Of all animals,
the ostrich is known to be the least provided with
craft. It never takes a circuitous course, but, confiding
in its swiftness alone, endeavours to escape in a line
straight as that of an arrow. Five horsemen station
<a id='Page_286'></a>themselves at intervals of a league in the direction it is
certain to take. Each one acts as a relay. When one
pulls up, the next clashes off at a gallop in pursuit of
the bird, which is thus deprived of a moment's rest, and
has to contend against horses that are fresh. The
horseman who is the last to start is necessarily the
victor, but his victory is not achieved without danger.
In falling, the ostrich, by the movement of its wings,
inspires the horse with a panic that is often fatal to the
rider.</p>

<p class='c009'>On horses that have to accomplish this terrific running
they place only a saddle-cloth, and a saddle of extreme
lightness. Some hunters use only wooden stirrups, and
an extremely light bit attached to a simple pack-thread.
Each one takes with him a small leathern bottle filled
with water, and from time to time moistens the bit, in
order to keep the animal's mouth tolerably cool. This
racing of five horsemen is not, however, the only mode
of hunting the ostrich. Sometimes, an Arab who is
thoroughly acquainted with the habits of the bird, takes
his post by himself close to a spot where it is in the
habit of passing—near a mountain defile, for instance—and
as soon as the ostrich comes in sight he gives
chace at full gallop. But it is rare for a hunter to
succeed by himself, as very few horses can overtake the
ostrich. However, I once possessed a mare that excelled
in this sport.</p>

<p class='c009'>Although the horse is usually employed in this as in
other kinds of hunting, he is not indispensable to man.
Craft may sometimes of itself overcome the ostrich. In
the laying season the hunters dig holes near the nests,
in which they squat down, and kill the parent bird as it
<a id='Page_287'></a>comes to visit its eggs. The Arabs have recourse,
likewise, to disguises. Some of them will clothe themselves
in the skin of the bird, and thus approach close to
those they wish to kill; but hunters, disguised in this
fashion, have sometimes, they say, been shot by their
own companions. If an ostrich has had a leg broken by
a ball, she cannot, like other bipeds, run along, hopping
on the other leg. This is because there is no marrow in
its bones, and, without marrow, bones will not mend
when they have been fractured. The Arabs affirm that
the ostrich is deaf, and that the sense of smell replaces
that of hearing.</p>

<p class='c009'>The hyæna is a powerful animal, with formidable
jaws, but a coward and afraid of daylight. For the most
part it dwells in caves which it finds in ravines and
among rocks. It seldom goes abroad but at night, and
searches for carrion and dead bodies, and commits such
ravages in graveyards, that the Arabs, by way of prevention,
bury their dead at a great depth. In some districts
they even construct two chambers for a single corpse,
which is then interred in the lower one. As a rule, it
does not attack the flocks; but sometimes at night,
prowling round an encampment, it carries off a dog.
The Arabs take little notice of it, though they amuse
themselves by hunting it on horseback, and let it be
pulled down by their greyhounds, but never pay it the
compliment of firing at it. After they have carefully
reconnoitred the cave in which it makes its lair, it is no
uncommon thing to find Arabs who despise the beast
sufficiently to penetrate boldly into its den, after having
carefully closed the entrance with their burnouses, so as
not to allow any light to enter. Having got thus far,
<a id='Page_288'></a>they go up to it, talking with great energy, seize hold
of it, gag it, without the slightest resistance on its part—so
terrified is it—and then drive it out with heavy
blows with a stick. The skin of such a cowardly brute is
little esteemed. In many tents they would not permit it
to enter, for it can bring nothing but misfortune. The
common people eat the flesh, which is not at all good,
but they carefully abstain from touching the head or
brains—contact with which, they believe, would make
them go mad.</p>

<p class='c009'>Let us leave this ignoble animal, and pass on to one
much more to be feared, and the chace of which presents
some striking scenes, though its reputation is far from
being in the eyes of the Arabs what it is in the imagination
of Europeans—I allude to the panther.</p>

<p class='c009'>The panther is found over the whole surface of Algeria,
though it inhabits only wooded coverts, and broken,
difficult ground. There are several species. Some
never quit the neighbourhood of their lair, and are called
<i>dolly</i>, that is, keeping to the house. Others, again,
which are called <i>berani</i>, or strangers, frequently wander
away from the place where they usually dwell, and
prowl about the surrounding districts to a considerable
distance.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <i>dolly</i> panther is larger, stronger, and more dangerous
than the other species. Its coat is speckled with
spots more elegantly disposed, of a very dark shade, and
close to one another. The colours are black, white, and
yellow. On the jowl, limbs, and back-bone, there are
no spots, but stripes. Those on the jowl are arranged
diagonally. The upper points start from the lower eyelids,
the nostrils, and the corners of the mouth, and
<a id='Page_289'></a>descend towards the neck, gradually melting away into
yellow, and finally lost in the white.</p>

<p class='c009'>Panthers lap like dogs. They generally roam in
couples. In districts that are well peopled, they are
never seen in the daytime. In uninhabited regions,
although they do go abroad in the day, they hunt only
at night. They have not more than two or three cubs.
The Arabs are far from regarding the panther with the
esteem they accord to the lion. The lion, say they, if
attacked, harassed, wounded, and surrounded by enemies,
feels his courage heighten in the midst of the uproar
and in the thick of the danger. He fearlessly encounters
his assailants and fights to the death, while the
panther only accepts the combat when it finds no way
to retreat. In a word, the lion, as soon as the combat
has fairly commenced, never retires, while the panther
escapes whenever an opportunity presents itself. Another
difference is this—the lion will devour a man, the
panther never. The latter generally strikes at his head,
lacerates him with its claws, and inflicts terrible bites,
and then, preferring the flesh of other animals to that of
a son of Adam, it leaves him there and goes in search of
other prey. In a country where it is able to supply
itself with the flesh of wild boar, sheep, cattle, and game
of all kinds, and where it can satiate itself with the
carcases of animals, it kills man, not because it is hungry,
but in self-defence, as the only way of shaking off
an enemy. In the case of the lion, man is often the
game in quest of which he stalks abroad; while in that
of the panther he is an adversary to be avoided, and
never to be provoked. You may pass boldly and confidently
close to the thick brushwood that conceals it,
<a id='Page_290'></a>and, if you do not begin the attack, it will remain
crouched as close as a partridge, even holding in its
breath. But if you fire and miss, it will spring upon,
bite, and lacerate you, and then, still distrustful of itself,
will take itself off.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Arabs have remarked, from the numbers of persons
who have come in collision with panthers, and been
wounded without being killed, that it uses only its teeth;
its bite being like that of the dog, and injuring only the
flesh. The lion, on the other hand, by his violent shaking,
breaks the bones of the victim he holds in his powerful
jaws. When the panther has inflicted its bite, it does
not trouble itself as to its being fatal or otherwise, but
makes off with fear and caution. The lion grows more
and more furious, and returns to the attack again and
again. It is not enough that the enemy be disabled—he
must feel the whole weight of a lion's wrath. The lion
bounds into a <i>douar</i>, and plunders boldly, at his leisure.
He seizes his share without any concealment; he has no
fear; he is exercising his right, the right of the strongest.
The panther covers its advance, glides, creeps,
crawls along like a thief, accompanied by shame and fear.
The panther's spring, when enraged, is like a flash of
lightning; but after that tremendous effort, its pace is
less swift than that of an ordinary horse. If a panther be
surrounded, tracked down, and hard pressed—maddened
by terror rather than by rage—it will spring on the tree
in which the hunters are stationed, and close with them.
But at another time, if only one or two men are lying in
ambush, and it be not shut in on all sides and a path is
left for escape, it forgets its power and runs away. Everywhere
and at all times, the lion is a dangerous enemy,
<a id='Page_291'></a>to encounter whom is a terrible undertaking; whereas
no one need dread the panther unless he has first attacked
it. The cry of the latter animal resembles the clear,
shrill, impotent neigh of the mule, and is in no way
calculated to inspire terror like the roar of the lion,
which is as the growling of thunder. But it is quick and
agile, and its movements baffle the eye. If the natural
disposition of the panther leads it to spare, or at least to
avoid, man, and to choose for its prey animals wild or
tame, such as sheep, cows, gazelles, and antelopes, that
cannot defend themselves, it is equally instructed by
instinct to modify its mode of attack upon animals whose
habits or courage render them difficult or dangerous to
assail—against such, it has usually recourse to surprise.
It will not attack a horse in the centre of a <i>douar</i>. Its
habitual circumspection and cowardice will restrain it
from seeking to seize upon a prey that might be rescued
in time, or promptly avenged. Even when out grazing,
a horse by itself might escape by galloping off; but if it
has not been seen, or suspected, if with a single bound
it can fall upon the horse, he is lost.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nor is the wild boar an easy victim. If it be full
grown, and have had warning, and there be room
enough, it will defend itself successfully. At times,
indeed, it comes off absolutely victorious—the Arabs
having found panthers in desert places, ripped up by
a boar's tusks. A frequent struggle, perhaps the only
one which the panther openly engages in, is with the
porcupine; but the latter, though it grows to a considerable
size in Africa, is more formidable in appearance
than in reality. It has indeed, the property of bristling
up its long, hard, sharp-pointed quills, which it can even
<a id='Page_292'></a>throw to some distance; but these arms cannot save it.
The slightest wound completely paralyses the muscular
contractions by means of which it places itself in a
state of defence: besides, it cannot do anything without
something to fall back upon, such as a tree or a stone.</p>

<p class='c009'>However timorous and apt to run away the panther
may be under ordinary circumstances, it becomes really
dangerous if its cubs have been carried off in its absence—or
under its very eyes by force, which only happens
when the hunters are in considerable numbers. At such
times it will sometimes perish in the attempt to save
them—at least, the <i>dolly</i>, or larger species will do so;
but the <i>berrani</i>, or small panther, makes off, uttering
the while lamentable cries. The cubs, thus torn from
their mother, are given to chiefs residing in towns, to
Sultans, Pashas, and Beys; but they are never kept in a
tribe, for when still quite young they are dangerous
even in their play, and no sort of attention will ever
tame them or guarantee the master of the tent, or his
wives and children, from a momentary outburst of fury
on the part of the perfidious and capricious brute. We
may mention, however, that in certain <i>zaouïas</i> lions are
tamed by marabouts and led up and down the tribes.
Thus summoning curiosity to the aid of charity, they
augment the amount of the alms which they beg for
their congregation. The most celebrated <i>zaouïa</i> in
which tame lions are kept is that of Sidi-Mohammed-ben-Aouda,
a tribe of the Flittas in the province of Oran.</p>

<p class='c009'>With this special exception the Arabs—and it is a
characteristic trait worthy of note—never rear any but
inoffensive animals. There is not a tent without a
gazelle, an antelope, a jackal, an ostrich, or a falcon;
<a id='Page_293'></a>but in no <i>douar</i> is a savage beast ever to be seen, such as
a hyæna, a panther, or a lion. Some tribes take
pleasure in rearing a young wild boar, under the idea
that it amuses the horses, which like its smell. The
little pig is faithful and always in motion. When the
tribe is changing ground, it trots about, grunting
joyously in the midst of the other animals, and accompanies
the sheep and the calves to the pasture. It is
called "the father of good fortune," and strangely
enough, it is a lucky omen to meet a wild boar on issuing
from one's tent. Prior to Mohammed the Arabs used to
eat swine's flesh, but the Prophet forbade it to them, as
well as the blood of animals and the flesh of every
creature that has not been bled.</p>

<p class='c009'>The panther, as I have already remarked, seldom goes
abroad during the day; but if, by chance, shepherds or
travellers happen to alight upon one near an inhabited
neighbourhood, they utter in shrill tones <i>ha houa!</i> "there
it is!" These cries are repeated with incredible rapidity.
The entire population swarms forth—horse and foot,
armed with whatever first comes to hand, guns, sticks,
swords, spears, or pistols, and followed by their dogs
and greyhounds. Surrounding on every side the spot
whither the beast has retired, generally difficult ground,
covered with thick high brushwood, they attack it
fearlessly and usually end by killing it. It rarely
happens that it escapes while it is light.</p>

<p class='c009'>But when, instead of this sudden outbreak of an entire
population against an unexpected enemy, a genuine
hunt is projected, certain preparations are made before
starting. It is true, the panther will run away if it has
the chance, but it is always possible that it may show
<a id='Page_294'></a>fight; and although, in the long run, it is sure to be
mastered without a single casualty on the side of the
hunters, it is as well to guard against the wounds it
may inflict, however insignificant in themselves. It
usually flies at the head. Against the lacerations of its
teeth and claws a sufficient defence is the thick woollen
cap, the <i>shashia</i>, the numerous folds of the haïk, the
hood of the burnous, and the long, coarse camel's rope.
But the enemy may with a single bound spring on to a
horse's croup, and with one blow on the head with its
paw knock over, stun, and even kill the rider. On this
account they not unfrequently don a helmet—a helmet
of modest pretentions, which at other times serves as a
kettle.</p>

<p class='c009'>The panther is also killed, like the lion, from an
ambush. A hole is dug in the earth and covered over
with branches, through which an opening is made for
the rifle of the concealed hunter, who fires at the
distance of about fifteen paces, as the animal approaches
to devour the carcase of a sheep or goat placed there for
that purpose. But lest the brute, if only wounded,
should spring upon the <i>melebda</i>, as the hunter's hiding
place is called, the latter is always provided with two or
three guns, and perhaps with pistols likewise. At other
times a gun is fastened to a tree, and at the muzzle of
the barrel is fixed a bait, to which a string is tied, that
passes round the tree and is attached to the trigger—so
that if the bait be pulled at all forcibly the gun is sure to
go off. And if the panther is not shot dead, it is certain
to be wounded, and the hunters set off in pursuit,
guided by the tracks of blood it leaves on its path.
There is yet another mode of killing the panther, which
<a id='Page_295'></a>is by surprising it while sleeping. Should it happen to
be awake, it is merely a disappointment, not a danger,
for it runs away at sight of a man.</p>

<p class='c009'>But whatever be the nature of the sport in which the
Arabs indulge, the least timorous are liable to superstitious
fears. As it is not always possible to relinquish
an enterprise when they have once entered upon it,
they endeavour by all means to avoid chances of sinister
omen. On the other hand they become emboldened, and
take courage if, on setting out, they are greeted by one
of those encounters which are reputed fortunate—with
a jackal in the morning for instance, or with a wild boar
in the evening.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Let thy morning be with a jackal,</div>
      <div class='line'>And thy evening with a wild boar.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>A hare or a fox is of ill omen; as is, also, a single
crow, or a white mare. A still worse and more detestable
omen is the sight of an old woman. But it is a
good chance for whoever sees two crows or a mare of
any colour; and, above all, success, glory, and plunder,
await the <i>goum</i> that, when starting on an expedition, is
met by a beautiful young and noble maiden, who will
uncover her bosom and show one of her breasts. It is
the custom; and if the damsel were to refuse this blessing
to the warriors of her tribe, they would dismount to
compel her, were she the daughter of the chief and
though he were himself at the head of the <i>goum</i>—all
the better, indeed, if her birth were so exalted, for the
nobler the damsel, the happier the augury. In the west,
young girls loosen their girdle. If, in the morning,
you hear affectionate and courteous words, you will have
<a id='Page_296'></a>a pleasant day; but it will be the reverse if on first
awaking you are greeted with an imprecation or an insult.
Do not go out to hunt on a Tuesday, a Thursday,
or a Friday.</p>

<p class='c009'>We now come to the sport that is really worthy to
sharpen the intelligence and inflame the souls of warriors.
The Arab hunter acts upon the aggressive with
the lion. In this daring enterprise there is all the more
merit, because in Africa the lion is a formidable monster,
regarding whom there exist many mysterious and
terrible legends, with which an awe-struck superstition
surrounds his dread Majesty. With that keenness of
insight which characterises them, the Arabs have made
a series of observations on the subject of the lion that
are worthy of being collected and preserved.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the daytime the lion rarely seeks to attack man.
Very commonly, indeed, if a traveller happens to pass
near him, he turns aside his head and affects not to see
him. At the same time, if any one, walking close to the
bush in which he is couched, be rash enough to cry
aloud <i>ra hena</i>—"he is there!"—the lion will at once
spring upon his denouncer and the disturber of his repose.
As night comes on, his humour completely changes.
When the sun has set, it is perilous to venture into a
wild, woody, and broken country. It is there the lion
lies in ambush—it is there he is met on the path-ways,
which he intercepts by barring all further advance
with his body. The Arabs thus describe some of the
nocturnal scenes which are continually happening. If
a solitary individual, a courier, traveller, or letter-carrier,
chancing to meet a lion, possess a courage of the
highest temper, he will walk straight towards the
<a id='Page_297'></a>animal, brandishing his sword or gun, but carefully
abstaining from using the one or the other. He simply
cries out: "Oh, the robber! the highway-man! the son
of a mother who never said No! Dost thou think to
frighten me? Thou canst not know, then, that I am
so-and-so, the son of so-and-so? Get up, and let me
proceed on my journey." The lion waits till the man
has come close up to him, and then goes off to lie down
again a thousand paces farther on. The traveller has to
endure a long series of terrific trials. Each time that
he quits the path, the lion disappears, but only for an
instant. Directly afterwards he again presents himself,
and all his movements are accompanied by horrible
noises. He breaks off innumerable branches with his
tail. He roars, howls, growls, and emits gusts of
poisonous breath. He plays with the subject of his
fantastic and manifold attacks, and keeps him constantly
suspended between fear and hope, like a cat playing
with a mouse. If a man involved in such a difficulty
does not allow his courage to fail him, if—to use an
Arab phrase—he succeeds in firmly holding his soul,
the lion will finally leave him, and seek his fortune elsewhere.
But if, on the contrary, the latter perceives that
he has to deal with a man whose countenance betrays
his fear, whose voice trembles, and who dares not
articulate a word, he repeats over and over again, in
order to terrify him still more, the manœuvre above described.
He will approach him, push him out of the way
with his shoulder, cross his path every other minute, and
amuse himself with him in various ways, until at last he
devours his victim already half dead with terror.</p>

<p class='c009'>There is really nothing incredible in the facts thus
<a id='Page_298'></a>stated by the Arabs. The ascendancy of courage over
animals is indisputable. The professional robbers who
roam abroad at night, armed to the teeth, instead of
shunning the lion, cry out to him if they meet with him:
"I am not what thou seekest. I am a robber like thyself;
pass on, or, if it please thee, let us rob in company." It
is said that the lion sometimes follows them, and attempts
an assault on the <i>douar</i> towards which they are bending
their steps. It is even affirmed that this good understanding
between the robbers and the lions frequently
displays itself in a striking manner. Robbers have been
seen, when taking their meals, to treat the lions as other
people treat their dogs, and throw to them at a certain
distance the feet and entrails of the animals they themselves
are eating.</p>

<p class='c009'>Women likewise have been known successfully to
have recourse to intrepidity in opposing a lion. They
have run after him when engaged in carrying off a ewe,
and have forced him to let go his prey by giving him
a shower of blows with a cudgel, crying aloud all the
time: "Ah, robber! son of a robber!" The Arabs say
that the lion is seized with shame, and makes off as
quickly as possible. This trait shows that in the eyes
of the Arabs the lion is a peculiar sort of creature
midway between men and beasts, which, by reason
of its strength, appears to them to be endowed with a
special order of intelligence. The following legend,
intended to explain how it is that the lion allows a sheep
to escape him more easily than any other prey, is a
confirmation of this belief. Enumerating one day the
various feats his strength enabled him to accomplish,
the lion remarked: "<i>An sha Allah</i>—if it be the will of
<a id='Page_299'></a>Allah—I can carry off a horse without distressing
myself. <i>An sha Allah</i>, I can carry off a heifer, without
being prevented from running by its weight." But
when he came to the ewe, he deemed it so much beneath
him that he omitted the pious formula, "if it be the will
of Allah;" and, to punish him, Allah condemned him to
be never able to do more than drag it along.</p>

<p class='c009'>There are several modes of hunting the lion. When
one makes his appearance in the midst of a tribe, his
presence is indicated by a multitude of signs of all
kinds. The earth shakes, as it were, with roarings.
Then a series of losses and accidents take place. A
heifer, or a colt is carried off, or a man is missing. The
alarm spreads through all the tents. The women
tremble for their property and for their children.
Lamentations arise on all sides, and the hunters decree
the death of their troublesome neighbour. It is published
in the market-places that on such a day and at such an
hour, all who are capable of joining in the chace,
whether on horseback or on foot, must assemble in arms
at an appointed spot. Prior to this, the thicket has
been discovered to which the lion retires during the day.
Everything being ready, the hunters set out, the men
on foot leading the way. When they have arrived
within fifty paces of the bush in which they expect to
find the enemy, they halt and await him. Closing up,
they form three deep, the second rank ready to fill up
the gaps in the first if succour be necessary, while the
third, firm and compact, and composed of capital marksmen,
forms an invincible reserve. Then commences a
strange spectacle. The front rank begin to insult the
lion, and even send a few balls into his hiding place to
<a id='Page_300'></a>make him come out: "Look at him who boasts of being
the bravest of all, and yet dares not show himself before
men! It is not he—it is not the lion—it is a cowardly
thief, and may Allah curse him!" The animal sometimes
comes while they are abusing him in this manner,
and, looking round serenely on all sides, yawns and
stretches himself, and appears perfectly insensible to
what is passing around him.</p>

<p class='c009'>One or two balls now hit him, upon which, magnificent
in his audacity, he stalks forth and stands in front
of the bush which sheltered him. Not a word is spoken.
The lion roars, rolls his glaring eyes, draws back, crouches
down, again rises up, and by the movements of his
tail and body snaps off all the branches that surround
him. The front rank discharge their pieces, whereupon
the monster bounds forward, and generally falls dead
beneath the fire of the second rank, who step forward
and fill up the intervals left in the first. This is the
critical moment, for the lion resigns the contest only
when a ball has struck him in the head, or in the heart.
It is no rare thing to see him continue the fight with ten
or a dozen balls through his body. In other words, he
is seldom overpowered until he has killed or wounded
some of his foot assailants. The horsemen who accompany
the expedition have nothing to do, so long as
their foe does not quit the broken ground. Their part
commences when, as occasionally happens, the men on
foot have succeeded in driving out the lion upon a
plateau, or into the plain. The combat then assumes
a new aspect, full of interest and originality. Each
horseman, according to his hardihood and agility, spurs
on his horse at full speed, fires at the lion as at an
<a id='Page_301'></a>ordinary mark, at a short distance, and, wheeling his
horse round the moment he has fired, gallops off to reload
his piece before making a second assault. The lion,
attacked on all sides and wounded at every moment,
faces about in every direction, rushes forward, flees,
returns, and falls, but only after a glorious struggle.
His defeat, indeed, must inevitably terminate in his
death, for against horsemen mounted on Arab horses
success is impossible. He makes but three terrific
bounds, after which his pace is by no means swift, and
an ordinary horse will distance him without trouble. To
form a just idea of such a combat, it is absolutely necessary
to have witnessed one. Every horseman hurls an
imprecation; there is a wild confusion of sounds, the
burnouses fly out, the powder thunders, the hunters
crowd together or scatter widely apart. The lion
roars, the balls whistle, and the whole forms a scene of
movement and animation. But notwithstanding all
this tumult, accidents are very unusual. The hunters
have little to fear, unless a fall from their horse throws
them under the paw of their enemy, or—which is more
frequent misadventure—they are hit by a friendly but
ill-directed ball.</p>

<p class='c009'>Such is the most picturesque, the most warlike aspect
that lion-hunting assumes. Other measures, however,
are sometimes adopted, both more sure and more speedily
efficacious. The Arabs have observed that on the
morrow after he has carried off and devoured sheep or
oxen, the lion, suffering from a weak digestion, remains
in his lair, fatigued, oppressed with sleep, and incapable
of moving. When a place that is usually disquieted
with roaring is undisturbed for a whole night, it may
<a id='Page_302'></a>be inferred that the formidable inhabitant who dwells
therein is plunged in this state of lethargy. Upon this,
a man of devoted courage, following the tracks that lead
to the covert in which the monster is concealed, will go
up to him, take a steady aim, and shoot him dead upon
the spot with a ball between the two eyes. Kaddour-ben-Mohammed,
of the Oulad-Messelem, a section of the
Ounougha, is reputed to have killed several lions in this
manner.</p>

<p class='c009'>Recourse is likewise had to various forms of ambush.
The Arabs sometimes excavate a hole in the path the
lion usually takes, and cover it with thin woodwork,
which the animal breaks by its weight and is caught in
the trap. At other times they dig close to a dead body
a hole covered by thick boards, between which a small
opening is left to allow the barrel of a gun to pass
through. In this hole, or <i>melebda</i>, the hunter squats
down, and when the lion approaches the body, he takes
a careful aim and fires. Not unfrequently the lion, if he
has not been struck down, throws himself on the
<i>melebda</i>, shatters the barrier, and devours the hunter
behind his demolished rampart. On other occasions,
again, a single man will undertake an adventurous and
heroic enterprise, recalling the feats of chivalry.
Si-Mohammed-Esnoussi, a man of approved veracity, who
inhabited the Djebel-Guerzoul, near Tiaret, thus describes
his own mode of going to work:</p>

<p class='c009'>"I used to mount a good horse and proceed to the
forest on a bright moonlight night. In those days I
was a capital shot, and my ball never fell to the ground.
Then I began to cry aloud several times, <i>Ould el ataïah!</i>—'Daughter
of a mother who yields herself up!'—The
<a id='Page_303'></a>lion would come forth, and direct his steps towards the
spot whence issued the cry; and at that moment I fired
at him. Occasionally the same thicket would contain
several lions, who would issue forth all together. If one
of these brutes approached me from behind, I would turn
my head and fire at him over the back of my saddle, and
then go off at full gallop in the fear that I might have
missed him. If I was attacked in front, I wheeled my
horse round and repeated the manœuvre."</p>

<p class='c009'>The people of that district affirm that the number of
lions killed by Mohammed-ben-Esnoussi amounted to
nearly a hundred. This intrepid hunter was still alive
in the year 1253 [A. D. 1836]. When I saw him, he had
lost his eyesight. May he participate in the mercy of
Allah!</p>

<p class='c009'>A yet more dangerous sport than hunting the lion
himself, is hunting a lion's cubs. There are individuals,
however, adventurous enough to undertake even this
hazardous enterprise. Every day, about three or four in
the afternoon, the lion and lioness quit their lair to
make a distant reconnaissance, with the object, no doubt,
of procuring food for their litter. They may be seen
upon the summit of an eminence, examining the <i>douars</i>,
and taking note of the smoke that issues from them, and
of the position of the flocks. After uttering some
horrible roars, an invaluable warning to the surrounding
population, they again disappear. It is during this
absence that the hunters cautiously make their way to
the cubs and carry them off, taking care to gag them
closely, for their cries would not fail to bring back the
old ones, who would never forgive the outrage. After
an exploit of this nature the entire neighbourhood is
<a id='Page_304'></a>obliged to be doubly vigilant. For seven or eight days
the lions rush about in all directions, roaring fearfully.
The lion under such circumstances is a truly terrible
monster. At such a time the eye must not encounter
the eye.</p>

<p class='c009'>The flesh of the lion, though sometimes eaten, is not
good, but his skin is a valued gift, and presented only
to Sultans and illustrious chiefs, and occasionally, to
marabouts and <i>zaouïas</i>. The Arabs fancy that it is good
to sleep upon one, as it drives away the demons, conjures
up good fortune, and averts certain diseases.
Lion's claws, mounted in silver, are used as ornaments
by women; while the skin of his forehead is a talisman
worn by some persons on their head to preserve the
energy and audacity of their brain. In short, lion-hunting
is held in high repute among the Arabs. Every
combat with that animal may take the device: <i>Kill or
Die!</i> He who kills him, eats him—says the proverb—and
he who kills him not is eaten by him. In this spirit
they bestow on any one who has killed a lion, this laconic
and virile eulogy: <i>Hadak houa</i>—"that one is he!" A
popular belief illustrates the grandeur of the part played
by the lion in the life and imagination of the Arabs.
When a lion roars, they pretend that they can readily
distinguish the following words: <i>Ahna ou ben-el mera</i>—"I
and the son of woman." Now, as he twice repeats
<i>ben-el mera</i>, and only once says <i>ahna</i>, they conclude that
he recognizes no superior save the son of woman.</p>

As in the desert there is very little water, and
there are long distances to be traversed, the Almighty
has endowed them with the faculty of easily enduring
thirst. In winter they never drink. The Prophet more
than once gave the following advice: "Never utter
coarse remarks on the subject of the camel or of the
wind: the former is a boon to men, the latter an emanation
from the soul of Allah." Camels are the most
extraordinary animals in the world, and yet there are
none more docile, owing to their being so much with
<a id='Page_306'></a>men. So great, indeed, is their docility, that they have
been known to follow a rat, that, in the act of gnawing,
pulled a rope smeared with butter, by which they were
fastened. Such is the will of Allah. These apophthegms
suffice to show that the camel is, of all created
animals, the most useful in respect of the wants of the
Arabs.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Arabs of the Sahara can tell the age of a camel
by its teeth. They say it is long-lived, though they
cannot give any very precise information on the subject.
They put the case, however, in this manner. If a camel
be born on the same day with a child, it has reached old
age by the time the latter has distinguished himself in
combats, which implies the age of eighteen to twenty-five
years. Camels require much care and experience
in managing them. Whenever it is possible, the male
camels are led to a different pasture from the females.
After the 15th of April, they are not sent out to feed until
the afternoon, because it has been remarked that the
grass is covered with a sort of dew that lays the foundation
of fatal diseases. Care is also taken to prevent the
camels from eating within the <i>douar</i> what remains in
the morning of the small quantity of grass given to the
horses overnight. These precautions are necessary
during the six weeks or two months in which the dew
is observed. Throughout the whole winter, the end of
autumn, and the beginning of spring, the camels may
be permitted, with advantage, to browse on shrubs with
a salt flavour; but in the beginning of April, and at the
end of May, they must not be allowed to do so for more
than five or six days.</p>

<p class='c009'>The shearing of the camels takes place in the latter
<a id='Page_307'></a>part of April. They are made to lie down, and are
operated upon by the shepherds and female slaves, a
woman standing behind them to gather the fleece which
she thrusts into bags. It is a somewhat slow operation.
<i>El oubeur</i>, or camel's fleece, is used in making canvas
for tents, camel-ropes, sacks called <i>gherara</i>, and <i>djellale</i>,
or horse-cloths. It is mixed almost invariably with
common wool.</p>

<p class='c009'>The ordinary burden of a camel is two <i>tellis</i> of wheat,
or about 250 kilogrammes. If not over-driven, it can go
from dawn to sunset, at least if it be allowed, as it journeys
along, to elongate its neck and pluck the herbage
that grows on either side of its path. In this manner it
will cover from ten to twelve leagues in the twenty-four
hours, and every fifth day it must be permitted to rest.
In the desert, camels are let out to hire, not by the day,
but by the journey, going and returning, according to
the distance. For instance, from El-Biod, among the
Oulad-Sidi-Shikh, to the Beni-Mzab, or about fifty leagues,
costs from two to three <i>douros</i>, and from the same
point to Timimoun six or seven <i>douros</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>The flesh of the camel is eaten as food. The animal,
however, is seldom killed unless it has a broken leg, or
is sick. The flesh is sometimes salted, and, after being
dried in the sun, is kept as a provision on a journey.
The love and veneration felt by the Arabs of the Sahara
for their camels are quite intelligible. "How should we
not love them?" they exclaim. "Alive, they transport
ourselves, our wives, our children, our baggage and
provisions, from the land of oppression to that of liberty.
The weight they can carry is enormous, and the distance
they traverse very considerable. In other words, they
<a id='Page_308'></a>further the relations of commerce and render aid in war.
Thanks to them, we are able, whenever we please, to
shift our encampment, whether in search of new pasturages,
or to escape from an enemy. Moreover, we drink
their milk, which is also useful in the preparations of
food, and neutralises the injurious qualities of the date.
Dead, their flesh is everywhere eaten with relish, and
their hump is sought after as a savoury dish. Their
skin serves as shoe-leather. If soaked, and then sewed
to the saddle-tree, it imparts, without the aid of a single
nail or peg, a solidity that nothing can affect. Then,
their sobriety and endurance of heat and thirst permit
them to be kept alike by rich and poor. They are truly
a boon from Allah, who hath said:—</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>SHEEP.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>No cattle are reared in the Sahara, owing to the scarcity
of water, the scantiness of the herbage, the stony
nature of the ground, and the frequent removals from
one place to another. But, if the desert be unfavourable
for the rearing of cattle, it is, assuredly, the veritable
country of the sheep. This animal finds there the salt
shrubs eaten by the camel, as well as many fragrant
and nutritious plants known by the generic name of <i>el
aâsheub</i>. Water it obtains from the ponds supplied by the
rains, or from the basins formed by the side of wells, and
kept up with great care. The wells themselves are, for
the most part, surrounded with masonry, and sheltered
from the drifting sands. Sheep, besides, are patient of
thirst. In spring, they are given to drink once in five or
six days; in summer, every other day; in autumn, every
third day; and in winter every fourth day. During the
great heats of summer, they are not allowed to touch
the pools of water lying on the surface of the ground,—experience
having shown that at that period of the year
stagnant water, rendered tepid by the sun's rays, is very
unwholesome. If a drought happens to have prevailed
<a id='Page_310'></a>during the first two months of spring, and if rain falls
plentifully in the third, the herbage grows luxuriantly,
and is called <i>khelfa</i>, or compensation. As if to make
amends for their long abstinence, the sheep eat it greedily,
but it is apt to give them a sickness named <i>el ghoche</i>,
or treason. This disease does not manifest itself until
after the summer heats. The head and lower jaw become
much swollen, the animal coughs continually, and
death usually supervenes. According to the Arabs, a
rainy autumn, by causing fresh grass to spring up early,
greatly tends to mitigate the pernicious effects of the
<i>ghoche</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sheep are very prolific. They generally lamb twice
in the year—in the early part of spring and autumn.
The large tribes possess from two to three hundred
thousand sheep, which are divided into flocks of four
hundred, called <i>ghelem</i> or <i>aâssa</i> [a stick]. Wealthy
individuals have from fifteen to twenty <i>ghelem</i>, and the
poorest a half, or even a quarter <i>ghelem</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the Sahara there is a species of sheep that yields a
magnificent wool, very soft but not very long. This is
the wool employed in the manufacture of articles of
luxury. These animals are nearly red in the head, and
the ewes give a great deal of milk.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is said of the finest ewes of this breed:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>They see like an owl,</div>
      <div class='line'>And walk like a tortoise.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Their wool descends to their hoofs and so completely
covers their head that, literally, nothing but their eyes
is visible. In the Sahara and in the <i>kuesours</i>, a <i>zedja</i>, or
fleece, is worth only one <i>boudjou</i>, but the price is greatly
<a id='Page_311'></a>enhanced by the time it reaches the Tell, and especially
the sea-coast. Some sheep have no horns, and are called
<i>fertass</i> [bald]. Others, again, have four, and are known
as <i>el kuerbourb</i>; while others have horns that are bent
back, and are named <i>el kheroubi</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Arabs take no care whatever of their sheep.
They have no sheds in which to shelter them from the
severity of the weather, nor supplies of forage to save
them from starvation. Consequently, in bad seasons
they frequently lose one-half of their flocks, and if
blamed for this carelessness, or offered advice, they
answer quite simply: "To what purpose is all that?
They are the property of Allah [<i>Kher Eurby</i>]. He does
with them as it pleases Him. Our ewes give us two
lambs every year. Next year our losses will be repaired."</p>

<p class='c009'>The following sentiments are ascribed to sheep:—</p>

<p class='c009'>"I love the close hand, that is, to belong to a miser
who would neither sell us, nor slaughter us for the
entertainment of his guests.</p>

<p class='c009'>"I love distant market-places; for when they are near
to my master, for one reason or another we are sold, or
slaughtered.</p>

<p class='c009'>"And every day a new house; that is, fresh and more
abundant pasturage."</p>

<p class='c009'>Sheep are the fortune of the child of the desert. He
says of them: "Their wool serves to make our tents, our
carpets, our garments, our horse-cloths, our sacks, our
nose-bags, our camel's-packs, our ropes, our cushions.
And what remains in excess of our own necessities we
sell in the <i>kuesours</i> or in the Tell, when we go there,
after harvest, to buy grain. Their flesh we eat, or give
it to be eaten by the guests of Allah. Dried in the sun,
<a id='Page_312'></a>it will keep, and be of use to us in our journeys. Their
milk is very serviceable to our families, whether as drink
or food. We make of it <i>leben</i> or <i>sheneen</i> [sour milk], and
what is over we give to our horses. We also get butter
from it, which enters into the preparation of our food, or
which we exchange in the <i>kuesours</i> for dates. Of their
skin we make cushions, and buckets to draw water from
the well. With it we ornament the <i>aâtatouches</i><a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c011'><sup>[90]</sup></a> of our
women, or we dress it for shoe-leather. We have no
need to plough, or sow, or reap, or thresh out the corn,
or to fatigue ourselves like vile slaves, or like the wretched
inhabitants of the Tell. No; we are independent,
we pray, we trade, we hunt, we travel, and if we have
occasion to procure that which others can only obtain by
sweat and toil, we sell our sheep, and forthwith provide
ourselves with arms, horses, women, jewels, clothes, or
whatever else affords us gratification, or embellishes our
existence. The owner of sheep has no need to labour,
nor is he ever in want of anything. So Allah has willed
it!"</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <a id='Page_313'></a>
  <h2 class='c004'>LIFE IN THE DESERT.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>In studying life in the desert, I have been greatly
struck by its analogy to that of the Middle Ages, and by
the resemblance which exists between the horseman of
the Sahara and the knight of our legends, romances, and
chronicles. This analogy will appear yet more real, this
resemblance yet more striking, on a close observation
of the accessory characteristics which I now propose to
sketch with a rapid hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>By the Arab of the Sahara, I do not mean a dweller in
the <i>kuesours</i>. The latter is rallied by the wandering
tribes as much as the inhabitants of the Tell, and
receives at their hands all sorts of derisive epithets.
Grown fat through his habits of indoor and commercial
life, he is called "the father of the belly," the grocer,
the pepper-dealer. This rearer of fowls—the Arab of
the tent possesses no fowls—this shopkeeper resembles
the simple citizen of all countries and of all times. He
is, at bottom, the villain, the churl of the Middle Ages.
He is the Moorish citizen of Algiers—he has the same
placid, apathetic, crafty physiognomy.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is of the master of the tent that I propose to speak:
<a id='Page_314'></a>of him who is never more than fifteen to twenty days
without changing his abode; of the genuine Nomad, of
him who never enters "the tiresome Tell" but once a
year, and then only to purchase grain. My horseman, my
hunter, my warrior is the man with a hardy iron-nerved
constitution, a complexion embrowned by the sun, limbs
well proportioned, in stature rather tall than short, but
making light of the advantage of height, "of that lion's
skin on a cow's back," unless adroitness, activity, health,
vigour and, above all, courage be combined with it.
But if he values courage, he also pities rather than
despises, and never insults those who "want liver." It
is not their fault, he good-humouredly remarks, but the
will of Allah. His abstinence cannot be exceeded, but,
accommodating himself to circumstances, he never
neglects an opportunity of making a good and hearty
meal. His ordinary diet is simple and without much
variety; but, for all that, when the necessity arises, he
understands how to entertain his guests in a becoming
manner. When the <i>ouadâa</i>, or peculiar festival of a
tribe, or <i>douar</i>, comes round, at which his friends will
be present, he would not offer them the slight implied
by his absence, and though it may be at a distance of
thirty or forty leagues, he will not fail to go there and
fill himself with food. Besides, they know well that he
is quite ready to return their hospitality, and that they
have not to do with one of those stingy town traders who
never offer more than a space of four square feet to sit
down in, a pipe of tobacco, and a cup of coffee either
without any sugar at all, or sugared only after many
preliminary phrases, carefully enunciated in recommendation
of coffee without sugar.</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='Page_315'></a>Among the Arabs, everything concurs to give power
to the development of the natural man. Nervous, hardy,
sober, though occasionally displaying a vigorous appetite,
their eyesight is keen and piercing. They boast
that they can distinguish a man from a woman when
two to three leagues distant, and a flock of camels from
a flock of sheep at double that distance. Nor is this
mere bragging. The extent and clearness of their vision
arise, as in the case of our sailors, from the incessant
habit of looking far ahead over an immense and objectless
space. And, accustomed as they are to scenes
and objects always the same and which encircle them
within narrow limits, it would be strange if they did
not recognize them under almost any circumstances.
Nevertheless, diseases of the eye are very common. The
refraction of the sun's rays, the dust and perspiration
cause numerous misadventures, such as ophthalmia
and leucoma, and blind and one-eyed men are
numerous in many parts of the desert—for instance,
among the Beni-Mzab, at El Ghrassoul, Ouargla, and
Gourara.</p>

<p class='c009'>The dweller in the desert, in infancy and youth, has
beautiful white, even teeth; but the use of dates as his
habitual and almost exclusive diet spoils them as he
advances in years. When a tooth is entirely decayed, he
is compelled to have recourse to the armourer or farrier,
who is privileged to torture his patient, to break his jaw
with his pincers, and tear away the gums together with
the tooth that was troubling him.</p>

<p class='c009'>The genuine chief, the real great lord, rarely leaves
the saddle, and very seldom goes on foot, though he
wears both boots and shoes. The common Arab, however,
<a id='Page_316'></a>is an indefatigable walker, and in the course of a
day will get over an incredible distance. His ordinary
pace is what the French call the <i>pas gymnastique</i> [which
is quicker than the English "double"], and what he
himself calls a dog-trot. On flat ground, he generally
takes off his shoes, if he happens to have any, partly
that he may walk faster and more comfortably, and partly
that he may not wear them out. Consequently, his foot
is like that of antique statues, broad and flat, and with
the toes wide apart. He is never troubled with corns,
and more than once Christians, who have insinuated
themselves into caravans, have been detected by this
infallible sign and expelled. The sole of the foot acquires
such hardness, that neither sand nor stones affect
it, and a thorn sometimes penetrates to the depth of
several lines without being felt. In the desert, properly
so called, however, the sand during the great heat of
summer is so burning hot that it is impossible to walk
upon it with naked feet. Even the horses are obliged to
be shod, or their feet would become painful and diseased.
The dread of being bitten by the <i>lefâ</i>, a viper whose
venom is fatal, also compels the Arabs themselves to
wear buskins rising above the ankle.</p>

<p class='c009'>The most common disease of the foot is the <i>cheggag</i>,
or chaps, which are healed by having grease rubbed in,
and by being afterwards cauterised with a hot iron.
Sometimes these chaps are so long and deep that they
are obliged to be sewed up. The thread used for the
purpose is made of camel's sinews dried in the sun, and
split into parts as fine as silk; spun camel's hair is,
likewise, employed. All the inhabitants of the desert
make use of this thread to mend their saddles, and
<a id='Page_317'></a>bridles, and wooden platters. Every one carries about
with him a housewife, a knife, and a needle.</p>

<p class='c009'>Not a few turn their powers of pedestrianism to a
good account, and make it their profession. Hence
come the runners and messengers, who gird themselves
tightly with a belt. These who are called <i>rekass</i> undertake
affairs of great urgency. They will do in four
days what the ordinary runners take ten to accomplish.
They scarcely ever stop, but if they find it necessary to
rest they count sixty inhalations of the breath and start
again immediately. A <i>rekass</i> who receives four francs
for going sixty leagues thinks himself well paid. This
modest reward, however, is the more highly appreciated
because it is paid in actual money. Specie is rare, and
is the smallest portion of an Arab's fortune. The
restricted circulation, and the facility of providing for
the principal necessities of life without buying or selling,
by simply having occasional recourse to barter are far
from lowering the value of coined money.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the desert a special messenger travels night and
day, and sleeps only two hours in the twenty-four.
When he lies down he fastens to his foot a piece of cord
of a certain length, to which he sets fire; and, just as it
is nearly burned out, the heat awakens him. In 1846, an
Arab, named El-Thouamy, a native of Leghrouât, was
sent by the Kalifa Sid-Hamed-ben-Salem to Berryân, a
town situated in the country of the Beni-Mzab. Starting
at five in the morning from Kuesyr-el-Heyrân, he
reached his destination about seven in the evening of the
same day. In fourteen hours he had covered 168 kilomètres,
travelling at the rate of twelve kilomètres an
hour. This same Thouamy set out one day from
<a id='Page_318'></a>Negoussa to go to Berryân, a distance of 180 kilomètres,
charged with an important message, and accomplished
the journey in sixteen hours. During both of these
courses this man eat only a few dates and drank about
two <i>litres</i> of water.</p>

<p class='c009'>In 1850, El-Ghiry, of the tribe of the Mokhalif, was
hunting the ostrich, and, while wholly absorbed in
chasing a <i>delim</i>, his horse broke down just as his last
drop of water was exhausted. All trace of his companions
was lost. For thrice twenty-four hours he
wandered about at random, in the desert, without food
or water. During the day he slept under a <i>bethoum</i>, and
walked all night. His family had given him up entirely,
when at length they saw him approaching. At first they
could hardly recognize him, so utterly exhausted was he,
so blackened by the sun, and reduced to such a skeleton.
He afterwards related that he believed he owed his life
to his dreams, in which he beheld his mother tending
him, and giving him something to eat and drink. These
visions, he said, had comforted and sustained him in his
sore distress.</p>

<p class='c009'>Let us now pass on from these examples of vigour and
abstinence, which might be multiplied to infinity, and
give a tolerably correct estimate of the goods and chattels
of a Saharene nomad. This inventory will afford a far
better idea of life in the desert than can be obtained from
a long description. I take a man of influential family,
and assume that his household is constituted after the
following fashion. Himself, four wives, four sons, the
wives of two of his sons, each of whom has a child, four
negroes, four negresses, two white men servants, two
white women servants: in all, twenty-five souls. He
<a id='Page_319'></a>may also, of course, have daughters, but they are sure
to be married, and are no further trouble to him. Such
a household as this will possess:</p>

<p class='c010'>An Arab who possesses such a fortune does no work.
He attends the meetings and assemblies of the <i>djemâa</i>,
hunts, rides about, looks at his flocks, and prays. His
only occupations are political, warlike, and religious. A
poor Arab equally disdains manual labour. He is not
forced to it, for there is no other kind of cultivation than
that of date-trees, which is left to the inhabitants of the
<i>kuesours</i>. Negroes are numerous and cost very little,
and, with the assistance of a few white servants, suffice
for the services which the free men refuse to perform for
themselves. Some of the latter, however, mend their
sacks and harness, but they form the exception. There
<a id='Page_324'></a>are likewise farriers, but these, in fact, are artists—the
privileges that are accorded to them, of which I have
already had occasion to speak, constituting them a sort of
special corporation. The armourers are, in truth, mere
workmen who repair, but cannot manufacture, arms.
The Arabs of the desert are for the most part worse
armed than those of the Tell, though their chiefs yield
to none in pomp and luxury. This is easily accounted
for. As they obtain their arms from Tunis by way of
Tougourt, or from Morocco through the Gourara country,
the great distance to be traversed prevents them
from getting their arms repaired as soon as they need
repairs, and the unskilfulness of those who undertake
this business will not permit them to do their work very
efficiently. Many of the Saharenes are still armed with
lances, which they seldom use except when pursuing
runaways. Their spears consist of a shaft of wood six
feet long, with a flat double-edged head of iron, and are
usually carried in a bandolier.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Arab of the Sahara is very proud of his mode of
life, which is not only exempt from the monotonous toil
to which the inhabitant of the Tell is subject, but is full
of action and excitement, of variety and incident. If
beards grow white at an early age in the desert, it is not
only because of heat, fatigue, journeys, and combats,
but much more from care, anxiety, and grief. He alone
does not turn gray who "has a large heart, is resigned,
and can say: It is the will of Allah!" This pride in
their country and in their peculiar mode of existence
amounts to positive contempt for the Tell and its inhabitants.
What the dweller in the desert chiefly plumes
himself upon is his independence; for in his country the
<a id='Page_325'></a>lands are wide and there is no Sultan. The chief of the
tribe administers and renders justice, a task of no great
difficulty where every delinquency has been provided for
and its appropriate penalty fixed beforehand. Whoever
steals a sheep, pays a fine of ten boudjous. Whoever
enters a tent to see his neighbour's wife, forfeits ten ewes.
Whoever takes life, must lose his own; or, if he makes
his escape, all that belongs to him is confiscated, save
only his tent, which is given up to his wife and children.
The fines are set apart by the <i>djemâa</i> for defraying the
expenses of travellers and marabouts, and of presents to
strangers. Thefts within the tribe are severely punished.
If committed on another tribe, they are looked over, and,
if a hostile tribe be the sufferers, are even encouraged.</p>

<p class='c010'>The women attend to the cooking, and weave various
kinds of carpets, sacks, stuff for tents, horse-cloths, camel-packs,
and nose-bags, while the negresses fetch wood
and water. Burnouses, <i>haïks</i>, and <i>kabaya</i> are made in
the <i>kuesours</i>. If rich, an Arab is always generous; and
rich or poor, he is sure to be hospitable and charitable.
He seldom lends his horse, but would regard it as an
insult if the animal were sent back to him. For every
present he receives he makes a return of greater value.
Some men are quoted as never having refused anything.
It is a common saying: "He who applies to a noble
never comes back empty-handed." It is needless to
speak of alms. Every one knows that next to a holy
war, and on the same line with going on a pilgrimage,
alms-giving is the act of all others the most pleasing to
Allah. If an Arab is sitting down to a meal, and a
mendicant, who happens to be passing, exclaims: <i>Mtâ
rebi ia el moumenin</i>—"of what belongs to Allah, O Believer!"—
<a id='Page_326'></a>he shares his repast with him if there be enough
for two, or else abandons it to him entirely.</p>

<p class='c010'>A stranger presenting himself before a <i>douar</i>, stands
some little way off, and pronounces these words: <i>Dif
rebi</i>—"a guest sent by Allah." The effect is magical.
Whatever may be his condition of life, they throw themselves
on him, tear him from one another, and hold his
stirrup while he alights. The servants lead away his
horse, about whom, if he be a man of good breeding, he
will not give himself any further trouble. He himself is
almost dragged into a tent, and whatever is ready to
hand is set before him, until a banquet can be prepared.
Nor is less attention shown to a traveller on foot. The
master of the tent keeps his guest company throughout
the whole of the day, and only leaves him to make way
for sleep. No indiscreet questions are ever asked, such
as: Whence comest thou? Who art thou? Whither goest
thou? There is no instance of any evil having ever
befallen a stranger thus received as a guest, even
though he were a mortal enemy. At his departure, the
master of the tent will say to him: "Follow thy good
fortune;" and after the guest has fairly taken his
departure, his entertainer is no longer answerable for
anything. In retiring from the hospitable repast, if the
stranger pass before a <i>douar</i> and be seen, he is obliged
again to accept the invitations that are pressed upon
him.</p>

<p class='c010'>A certain class of men live entirely on alms and hospitality.
These are the dervishes. Absorbed in prayer,
these pious individuals are the object of universal veneration.
"Beware of offering them an insult, for Allah
will punish you." A request made by them is never
<a id='Page_327'></a>refused. By the side of these mendicant monks, who so
exactly reproduce a particular feature of the Middle
Ages, it seems appropriate to place the <i>tolbas</i>, or learned
men, and the "wise women," who fill in the Sahara the
part that belonged in the olden times to the magicians,
alchemists, and sorcerers, and those other impostors
celebrated by Tasso and Ariosto, and ridiculed by Cervantes.
It is to these <i>tolbas</i> and aged dames that both
men and women apply for a philter, composed of various
herbs prepared with solemn invocations and awesome
or grotesque ceremonies, which is mixed with the food
of the swain or damsel whose love is longed for. It is
they, again, who write magic words and the name of the
hated one on a piece of paper and a dead man's bone
taken from a cemetery, and then bury together the paper
and the bone, which will soon be joined by the enemy,
"with his belly full of worms." They will teach you,
too, the formula you must pronounce while closing your
knife, in order to sever the life of an odious rival; and
that which you must throw into the furnace over which
is being cooked the food of the family you would poison;
and that which you must write on a copper plate, or
flattened ball, to be flung into the stream whither repairs
to drink the woman on whom you would avenge yourself—seized
with a dysentery as rapid as the river, she will
die, if she do not yield herself up to you. To effect her
cure, the first sorcery must be counteracted by a second.</p>

<p class='c010'>After these come the long train of spectres, the phantoms
of those who have died a violent death. If one of
them pursue you, lose no time in exclaiming: "Return
to thy hole. Thou canst not frighten me. I feared thee
not when thou didst carry arms." It will follow you yet
<a id='Page_328'></a>a little, but will soon desist. If you are seized with
terror and attempt to flee, you will hear in the air the
clashing of arms, and a horse in full pursuit behind,
with yells and horrible uproar, until you drop exhausted
by fatigue.</p>

<p class='c010'>In Morocco, on the banks of the Ouad Noun, about
twenty days march westward of Souss, the most famous
sorcerers are found. There is there a whole school of
alchemists and necromancers, and of occult sciences,
besides a talking mountain, and many others marvels of
the magical world. The common people alone are
debased to these superstitions. The wealthy, the marabouts,
the <i>tolbas</i> of the <i>zaouïa</i>; and the <i>sheurfaa</i>,
scrupulously follow the precepts of religion and read the
sacred books; but the vulgar herd are plunged in
ignorance, and barely know two or three prayers and
the confession of faith. They likewise pray very rarely,
and only perform their ablutions when they find water.
The chiefs do their utmost to dispel this ignorance. Even
on a journey they take care that the <i>moudden</i> never fail
to proclaim the hour of prayer, and they establish schools
in their tents. But a life of fatigue, wandering, and
migration, soon causes the Arabs to forget the lessons
of their childhood. Men of all ranks, however, take
pleasure in having them recalled to mind in the garb of
poesy by the <i>meddah</i>, or religious bards, who go about
at festivals singing the praises of Allah, and the saints,
and the holy war, accompanying themselves the while
with flute and tambourine. These bards are rewarded
with numerous presents.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <a id='Page_329'></a>
  <h2 class='c004'>THE ARAB ARISTOCRACY.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c015'>"Take a thorny shrub," said the Emir Abd-el-Kader
to me one day, "and water it for a whole year with
rose-water, and it will still yield nothing but thorns. But
take a date-tree, and leave it without water, without
cultivation, and it still will produce dates." From the
Arab point of view the nobles are this date-tree, and
the common people that thorny shrub. In the East,
great faith is placed in the power of blood and in the
virtue of race. The aristocracy is regarded not only as
a social necessity, but as an absolute law of nature. No
one ever dreams of revolting against this truism, which
is accepted by all with a placid resignation. The head
is the head and the tail the tail, is what the lowest of
the Arab shepherds would say.</p>

<p class='c010'>In addition to this long descended and sacred nobility
composed of the <i>sherifs</i>, or descendants of the Prophet,
there are two distinct classes of aristocracy—the one
the aristocracy of religion, the other the aristocracy of
the sword. The marabouts and the <i>djouad</i>—for such
are their designations—the former deriving their position
from their piety, the latter from their courage, the
<a id='Page_330'></a>former from prayer, the latter from battle, regard each
other with an implacable hatred. The <i>djouad</i> reproach
the marabouts with the offences which in all countries
are eagerly attributed to religious orders that aim at
the direction of human affairs. They accuse them of
ambition, of intriguing, of underhand proceedings, and
of an insatiable covetousness for the good things of the
earth masked by a pretended love of Allah and of Heaven.
One of their proverbs declares "From the <i>zaouïa</i><a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c011'><sup>[94]</sup></a> a
serpent is ever issuing." From this it appears that the
Arabs, while chaunting the praises of the aristocracy,
do not hesitate, sound Believers as they are, to speak
the truth with regard to their priesthood. The marabouts,
on the other hand, charge the <i>djouad</i> with
violence, rapine, and impiety. This last accusation
furnishes them with a terrible weapon of offence. They
stand in the same relation towards their rivals as did the
clergy of the Middle Ages towards the lay nobles who,
notwithstanding the imposing appearance of their
warlike power, could yet be reached by an anathema.
In like manner, if the <i>djouad</i> exercise an influence over
the people through the memory of perils encountered
and blood shed, and all the prestige of military
achievements, the marabouts on their part are armed
with the omnipotence of religious faith acting on
popular imagination. More than once has a marabout,
feared or loved by the people, imperilled the power and
even the life of a <i>djieud</i>.<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c011'><sup>[95]</sup></a> Nevertheless it is the <i>djieud</i>
whom I now propose to portray, because the life of the
<a id='Page_331'></a>desert is especially the life of the warrior. To exhibit at
one glance a noble of the Sahara in all the pomp, noise,
and animation of his existence, it is necessary to depict
the interior of a great tent at the moment when the day
begins, from eight o'clock to noon.</p>

<p class='c010'>The poets of antiquity have many a time described
the crowd of clients who were wont to inundate the
porticoes of a patrician palace in ancient Rome. A
great tent in the desert in these days resembles in its
way the luxurious mansions painted by Horace and
Juvenal. Gravely seated on a carpet, with that dignified
demeanour which is the peculiar privilege of Orientals,
the chief of the tribe receives in their turn all who come
to invoke his authority. This one complains of a
neighbour who has endeavoured to seduce his wife, that
one accuses a wealthy man of refusing to pay a debt,
another is anxious to recover some cattle that have been
stolen from him, while a fourth demands protection for
his daughter whom a brutal husband maltreats in the
most shameful manner. The first quality in a chief is
patience. Assailed on all sides by violent recriminations,
he lends an attentive ear to each, and strives to heal the
wounds of every description which are disclosed to him.
"A man in authority," says an eastern apophthegm,
"ought to imitate the physicians who never apply the
same remedies to all diseases." In these "beds of justice"
that recall the primitive manner in which our ancient
kings disposed of the private interests of their subjects,
the Arab chief employs the utmost sagacity, the greatest
force of character, with which he may have been endowed.
To some he gives orders, to others advice: to no one
does he refuse the aid of his wisdom and influence. Nor
<a id='Page_332'></a>has he need only of the quality that Solomon demanded
of the Lord. Wisdom must be combined with generosity
and valour. The highest praise that can be awarded is
to say of him that "his sabre is always drawn, his hand
always open." He must never weary of practising the
somewhat ostentatious, and yet at the same time noble
and touching, charity, enjoined by the Mussulman law
as an obligation on all Believers. His tent must be a
refuge for the unfortunate, nor may any one die of
hunger in his neighbourhood; for the Prophet hath said:
"Allah will never accord his mercy but to the merciful.
Believers, give alms, if it be only the half of a date.
Whoso gives alms to-day shall be amply recompensed
to-morrow."</p>

<p class='c010'>If a warrior loses the horse that was his sole strength,
if a family is robbed of the flocks that furnished its subsistance,
it is to the chief, and to the chief alone, the sufferers
address themselves. However strong may be the love
of pelf, it never goes so far as to make him risk the loss
of his influence; and the Arab noble, while in so many
respects resembling the Baron of the Middle Ages, differs
from him in one essential point—he abhors gambling.
Neither cards nor dice ever wile away the leisure hours
in a tent. An Arab chief may neither indulge in play,
nor lend money at usurious rates of interest. The only
way in which he may turn his money to account, is by
indirect participation in some commercial enterprise.
He hands over a certain sum to a merchant, who trades
with it, and, at the end of so many years, divides with the
lender the profits he has gathered. It must not, however,
be supposed that riches are therefore despised by
Orientals. With them, as in every other part of the
<a id='Page_333'></a>world, wealth is one of the indispensable conditions of
power. Whoever falls into poverty, falls also very
quickly into obscurity, while he who makes a fortune
enters upon the path of honours. But, in order to follow
out an ambitious career, it is by the right arm rather
than by industry that wealth must be acquired. When a
warrior has made a number of razzias that have brought
him at the same time glory and gold, he is surnamed
Ben-Deraou, "the son of his arm," and may aspire to
the highest dignities of the tribe. This brings us back
to the quality which should be the groundwork of every
noble Arab's soul—valour.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Nothing," said Abd-el-Kader, "throws out so well as
blood the dazzling whiteness of a burnous." An Arab
chief, like our captains in the olden times, should be
more valiant than all his men at arms. He must
distinguish himself by warlike feats as much as by his
bearing at fantasias. His influence would be for ever
lost if he were suspected of faintness of heart. But it is
the reality, not the appearance, which the Arabs
appreciate. What they admire is a spirit nobly tempered,
and not the frame of a mere giant, or athlete. This is
the place to combat the widely spread prejudice that a
lofty stature and bodily strength make a deep impression
upon them. Such is far from being the case. They
take pleasure in man's being robust, patient of thirst and
hunger, and capable of enduring severe fatigue; but they
care very little for tallness of stature, or for muscular
force like that of our porters, or showman's Hercules.
They reserve their esteem for activity, address, and
courage. It little matters to them whether a man be tall
or short; and not unfrequently, while looking at some
<a id='Page_334'></a>Colossus whose huge proportions are being vaunted in
their presence, they may be heard to murmur sententiously:
"What to us is the stature or strength! Let us
see the heart. After all, it may be only the skin of a
lion on the back of a cow."</p>

<p class='c010'>But notwithstanding this admiration of valour, there
is no point of honour among the Arabs such as prevails
among ourselves. In their eyes there is no cowardice
in retreating before superior numbers, or even in fleeing
before an enemy of inferior strength, if there is nothing
to be gained by fighting. They often laugh among
themselves at our chivalrous scruples. Fond as they
are of riding at furious speed, and of the noisy discourse
of fire-arms, they nevertheless desire to have some
object of public utility as their motive for battle. Full of
ardour so long as Fortune leads them on, they disperse
and disappear as soon as she betrays them. In forming,
therefore, their judgment of acts of bravery, there are
many essential points of difference between them and
ourselves. Their respect for courage never urges them
to excessive severity towards those who are deficient in
that quality. A coward will never rise to any post of
dignity in his tribe, but neither will he be an object of
contempt. They will merely say of him, with that
absence of anger which usually accompanies fatalism:
"It was not the will of Allah that he should be brave.
He is to be pitied rather than blamed." A man of faint
heart is expected, however, to redeem his shortcomings
by the prudence of his counsels, and above all by an
unfailing generosity.</p>

<p class='c010'>Braggadocio is treated with greater contempt than
cowardice. "If thou sayest that the lion is an ass, go
<a id='Page_335'></a>and put a halter on him," is an oriental proverb in very
general use. In spite of the heat of their blood and the
hyperbolical character of their speech, the Arabs demand
from true courage that dignified silence which they
regard so highly. In this respect they have nothing in
common with the nations with whom they fought in the
time of the Cid; nor yet under the head of single
combats, which are entirely unknown among them. A
tradition, which probably dates from the crusades,
asserts that in the olden time illustrious chiefs met each
other in single combat, but the oldest members of the
tribes of the present day have no personal recollection of
anything of the kind. If a man deems himself seriously
affronted, he avenges himself by assassination. There
are individuals with easy consciences and complacent
dispositions who, for a very moderate sum, will rid you
of an enemy. But if the aggrieved happens to be more
sparing of his gold than of his life—his hand being more
ready to strike than his purse to open—he watches his
opportunity to fall upon the man who has wronged him.
He kills him, or is killed by him. In the former case it
is a common thing to bequeath to another the debt of
blood; for, in the absence of duelling, private revenge is
in a very flourishing condition among the Arabs, and
descends from generation to generation. Among them
still prevail those family feuds which formerly dyed red
the pavements of Italian cities, and which even in the
present day stain the soil of an island of France.</p>

<p class='c010'>The ordinary causes of the Arab <i>vendetta</i> are disputes
as to wells, pasturage and landmarks, the rape of a
young wife or daughter, the murder of a jealous husband,
of a successful rival, or of a woman who has
<a id='Page_336'></a>refused compliance,—or rivalries of chiefs, whose quarrel
is espoused, first of all, by their relations, friends, and
clients, then by the whole tribe, and at last by the
tribes in alliance with them. As a natural consequence
of the absence of the duello, private disputes are settled
by assassination, and the feud, being transmitted from
kin to kin and constantly provided with new fuel, goes
on to eternity. The <i>vendetta</i> is either of a private or
public nature, according as the injury to be avenged
affects an individual or a tribe. If from any cause a man
happen to lose his life through the act of a chief, or even
of a humble member of a neighbouring tribe, the homicide
can arrange the affair legally by paying the <i>dya</i>,
or blood money, to the heirs of the deceased. The <i>dya</i>
is the same as the <i>Wehrgeld</i> of the Germans, with this
difference—that not only is it legal, but from its first
institution it assumed a religious character. According
to the <i>tolbas</i>, it may be traced back to Abd-el-Mettaleb,
the grandfather of Mohammed, and was indirectly the
cause of the birth of the Prophet. Abd-el-Mettaleb, chief
of the tribe of the Koreishites, had no children, and in
his despair he offered up the following prayer to Allah:
"Lord, if thou wilt bestow upon me ten sons, I swear
to sacrifice one of them unto thee as a thanksgiving
offering." Allah heard his prayer and made him ten
times a father. Faithful to his vow, Abd-el-Mettaleb left
it to the drawing of lots to decide who should be the
victim. The lot fell upon Abd-Allah; but, the tribe
opposing this sacrifice, it was resolved by the chiefs that,
instead of Abd-Allah, ten camels should be set aside as a
stake and recourse again had to lots until they turned
up in favour of the lad, ten camels being added to the
<a id='Page_337'></a>first for every time the lots had been unfavourable.
It was not until the eleventh trial that Abd-Allah was
redeemed, and one hundred camels were sacrificed in his
place. Some time afterwards Allah manifested His
satisfaction with this exchange, for He caused Mohammed
his Prophet to be born to Abd-Allah; and ever since
then the price of an Arab's life has been fixed at one
hundred camels. Circumstances, however, sometimes
occur to reduce this high standard.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is scarcely an instance on record of a homicide
who has paid the <i>dya</i> being otherwise proceeded against,
or of the parents or the children of the deceased
hesitating to accept this satisfaction. But if he be too
poor to pay it, or if the Government has thought fit to
interfere in the matter, he is condemned to suffer like for
like, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a life for a
life. When I was consul for France at Mascara, in 1837,
accredited to Abd-el-Kader, I had an opportunity of
witnessing the application of the <i>lex talionis</i> in its utmost
rigour. Two children having quarrelled in the street,
their fathers interposed, and from insults proceeded to
threats, until one of them, gradually becoming infuriated,
drew his knife and stabbed his adversary, who fell down
dead upon the spot. The latter received five wounds;
one on his right, a second on his left, breast, two in the
stomach, and the fifth in the back. A mob collected,
and the <i>shaoushs</i>, or police agents seized the murderer
and led him before the <i>hakem</i>, or mayor of the town.
The <i>aoulemas</i>, or doctors of the law, immediately
assembled, and constituted themselves a tribunal. In
less than half an hour the witnesses were heard, and the
culprit was sentenced to undergo the full penalty of the
<a id='Page_338'></a><i>lex talionis</i> at the hands of his victim's brother. At a
signal given by the Cadi, two <i>shaoushs</i> bound his wrists
together with a rope, and, placing themselves on either
side of him, conducted him, preceded by the executioner,
to the market-place, thronged at the time by two or
three thousand Arabs. However horrible might be the
singular drama about to be acted, it furnished me with
an opportunity for a rare experience, and I succeeded in
overcoming the instinctive repugnance, which I at first
felt, to being present. By the time I reached the spot,
the <i>shaoushs</i>, by dint of freely plying their sticks, had
forced back the crowd to the circumference of a spacious
circle, the centre of which was occupied by the executioner
and his victim, the one with his knife in his hand,
the other calm and indifferent to what was about to
happen. According to the sentence, the murderer was
to receive as many stabs as he had inflicted, and in the
same order and in the same parts of the body as the man
he had murdered. When all was ready,—and the preparations
were merely what I have described,—a <i>shaoush</i>
raised his staff, by way of signal. The Arab with the
knife immediately rushed on his victim, and stabbed him
first on the right and then on the left breast, but evidently
without touching the heart, for the poor wretch cried
aloud: "Strike! Strike! But think not that it is thou
who takest my life. Allah alone takes away life." The
punishment, however, was continued with horrible fury,
and the criminal, whose entrails protruded from two fresh
wounds he received in the belly, never ceased to revile
his executioner. There still remained one other blow to
give. The wounded man turned round of himself, and
the blade of the knife disappeared entirely in his loins.
<a id='Page_339'></a>He staggered, but did not fall. "Enough! Enough!"
cried the mob. "He gave only five blows, and he ought
not to receive more." The execution was over, and the
unfortunate man who underwent all this torture had still
sufficient strength to return to his own house on foot.
M. Warnier, physician to the consulate, arrived there
almost at the same instant as himself, and while he was
endeavouring to sew together the gaping mouths of the
two wounds in the belly, the patient kept crying aloud:
"Oh! I pray you, heal me! They say thou art a great
physician; prove it, heal me, so that I may kill that
dog!" It was all in vain, for that night he died.</p>

<p class='c010'>But if the murderer be the master of a great tent, and
sufficiently influential to induce the tribe to exercise forbearance
towards him, and therefore refuses to pay any
blood money, he will sooner or later expiate that refusal
with his life, which the <i>vendetta</i> will overtake though
justice lag behind. From his death, however, will arise
a deadly feud, as I have already shown. I could give
many instances of the <i>vendetta</i>; and the one that follows,
being equally illustrative of the customs of a powerful
Saharene tribe, the Shamba, and of those of a people of
the Great Desert, the Touareg, separated from one
another by at least two hundred leagues, will afford a
just notion of those obstinate hatreds, of that thirst for
vengeance which always embody themselves in the same
acts of violence. A band of the Shamba, commanded
by Ben-Mansour, chief of Ouargla, surprised, near the
Djebel-Baten, some Touaregs who were watering their
camels in the Oued-Mia, under the leadership of Kheddash,
chief of the Djebel-Hoggar. An implacable hatred,
the origin of which is unknown, divides the Shamba from
<a id='Page_340'></a>the Touaregs—the latter, besides, being in a state of
perpetual vendetta against the Saharenes, either because
they are Berbers and not Arabs, or because they levy a
tax on the caravans to and from Soudan. A bloody
conflict ensued, and the Touaregs were put to the rout,
leaving ten of their party dead upon the ground, and
among them their chief, whose headless body they found
some days afterwards. Ben-Mansour had carried off his
head, which he exposed, as a trophy of his victory, over
one of the gates of Ouargla. The tidings spread
mourning throughout the Djebel-Hoggar, and an oath
was taken: "May my tent be destroyed if Kheddash be
not avenged!" Kheddash left behind him a widow of
great beauty named Fetoum, and one young child.
According to usage, Fetoum was entitled to rule, assisted
by the Council of Nobles, until such time as her son
should be of age to assume the leadership. One day,
therefore, when the leading men were assembled in her
tent, she said to them: "My brethren, whichever of you
will bring me Ben-Mansour's head shall have me for
wife." That same evening all the young men of the
mountain armed themselves for war, and went to her,
saying: "To-morrow we will set out with our servants to
seek thy wedding present." And at the dawn of day
three hundred Touaregs, commanded by Ould-Biska, a
cousin of Kheddash, set out on their march to the northward.
Hardly had they taken up their position at their
first halt, when they beheld coming up behind them half
a score of camels with riders, and among them one
fleeter of foot and more richly accoutred than the others.
They at once recognized the camel of Fetoum, for
Fetoum had come in person to join their little army.
<a id='Page_341'></a>She was greeted with loud acclamations, for it seemed
to them, and perhaps with reason, that she had come
expressly to be able more promptly to fulfil her promise.
It was the month of May, when water is to be found in
every ravine, and the sands are clothed with herbage.
During the halt on the eighth day, the scouts came in
with the news that a strong body of the Shamba, commanded
by Ben-Mansour, were driving their flocks
towards the grazing grounds of the Oued-Nessa. The
Shamba, however, having received intelligence of the
approach of the Touaregs, had turned suddenly towards
the north and had already gained the Oued-Mzab. But
their retreat was speedily discovered, and by a forced
march of a day and a night, the Touaregs placed themselves
in ambush in ravines and brushwood at a distance
of only a few leagues from the enemy, who had now no
suspicion of their presence. All that day they rested,
and when night came they again took to the plain,
putting their camels to a long swinging trot. At length
about midnight the barking of the dogs betrayed the
<i>douar</i> of which they were in search. The next moment,
on a signal given by Ould-Biska, they dashed forward
uttering their war-cry. Of the Shamba, at the most not
more than five or six escaped, and one even of these was
wounded by Ould-Biska who, with a thrust of his long
spear, struck him in the loin. Run away with by his
mare, the ill-fated horseman, rolling from side to side
but still keeping his seat, went on a few steps, but
presently he sank forward and fell over on to the sand,
dragging down with him in his fall a child seven or
eight years of age whom he had till then kept concealed
in his burnous. "Ben-Mansour! Ben-Mansour! knowest
<a id='Page_342'></a>thou Ben-Mansour?" demanded Ould-Biska. "He was
my father—behold him!" replied the boy, calm and erect
beside the dead body. At that moment, Fetoum came up,
followed, surrounded, and closely hemmed in by a group
of the Touaregs. "It is I who have slain him!" cried
Ould-Biska. "And it shall be done as I said," answered
Fetoum; "but take thy poniard, open the body of the
accursed, tear out his heart, and throw it to the dogs."</p>

<p class='c010'>While Ould-Biska, kneeling on the ground and stooping
over the corpse, proceeded to execute this order,
Fetoum, her lips compressed and her whole frame trembling
with nervous excitement, gloated over the shocking
spectacle. And when at last the <i>slougui</i> had finished
their horrible repast, her revenge being now complete,
Fetoum remounted her <i>mahari</i> and gave the signal for
retreat, without taking any heed of the booty her followers
were piling up, or of the flocks they were driving
together. As to the son of Ben-Mansour, his life was
spared, but they abandoned him to his fate. For two
days he remained there, weeping, thirsting, hungering,
and exposed to the sun, but on the third day he was
found by some shepherds who conveyed him to Ouargla,
where he was living in 1845. Thus the dogs of the
Touaregs have eaten the heart of the chief of the Shamba,
and it may be easily imagined that this will be the
subject of an undying feud, that will know neither
respite nor mercy.</p>

<p class='c010'>I will not dwell any further upon customs impressed
with such savage energy. By way of contrast, I will
now trace some family sketches, commencing with the
reverence attached to the paternal authority. So long
as the child is in his infancy, the tent belongs to him,
<a id='Page_343'></a>and his father is in some respects the first of his slaves.
His sports are the delight of the family, his whims the
life and soul of the domestic circle. But as soon as he
attains to puberty, he is taught the utmost deference.
He is not even allowed to speak in the presence of his
father, or to attend the same meetings. This absolute
respect which he is bound to exhibit towards the head of
the family, he is also obliged to pay to his eldest brother.
However, notwithstanding their aristocratic severity,
the customs of the Arabs do not come up to the gloomy
rigour of the Roman Patricians. A father, for instance,
would never condemn his son to death unless he has
dishonoured his couch—for any other offence he would
merely banish him from his presence.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus far I have sketched with a coarse and rapid
pencil the character of the Arab aristocracy; I will
now endeavour to represent the actual life of a noble in
some of its most solemn moments.</p>

<p class='c010'>The day on which a child is born in a great tent is
one of much rejoicing. Every one visits the father of
the new-born, and says to him: "May thy son be
happy!" And while the men press round the father,
the mother is not neglected, for the women of the tribe
flock to see her. Both men and women have their hands
full of presents, proportioned to their means. From
camels, sheep, and costly apparel, down to grain and
dates, all the treasures of the desert abound in the tent
which Allah has just visited with his blessing. The
recipient of all these tokens of affection and respect is
obliged to exercise a large hospitality. Sometimes for
twenty consecutive days, he feeds and entertains his
guests. These festivals in the desert have that air of
<a id='Page_344'></a>grandeur which belongs to all the scenes that are enacted
in this solemn theatre of primitive life.</p>

<p class='c010'>As soon as the child is old enough, he learns to read
and write, which is an innovation among the <i>djouad</i>,
for until recently the marabouts alone cultivated letters.
The man of the sword, like our mediæval barons, held
learning in contempt. It seemed to him that, in cultivating
his mind, some sort of injury was done to his
energy of character. But since they have beheld the humblest
of our soldiers possessed of knowledge without their
courage being impaired, the Arabs have changed their
opinion on the subject. Besides, those who took service
with us soon discovered that education conferred a title
to favours. Many of them too, murmur to one another
with a tone of sad resignation: "Formerly we were able
to live in ignorance, for peace and happiness were with
us; but in this time of trouble through which we are
compelled to pass, science must come to our aid." Our
influence thus gradually accomplishes, in the very heart
of the desert, the work of civilisation, of which some
among us speak so despondingly, and others so lightly.</p>

<p class='c010'>The culture of letters, however, does not lead, in the
education of the Arab, to any neglect of the art of managing
a horse or of handling fire-arms. As soon as a
child can sit on a horse, he is placed, first of all, on the
back of a colt, and then on the full grown animal.
When his frame begins to take form, he is taken out
hunting, and taught to fire at a mark, and to bury his
spear in the flanks of a wild boar. By the time he has
attained his sixteenth or seventeenth year, has learned
the Koran, and has been accustomed to fast, he is
married. The Prophet has said: "Marry when young.
<a id='Page_345'></a>Marriage subdues the glance of the man's eye, and
regulates the conduct of the woman." Up to that epoch,
paternal tenderness watches over the purity of his
manners with unceasing vigilance. The lad is never left
to himself. A tutor or an attendant accompanies him
wherever he goes. Men of dissolute habits and women
of a loose course of life are carefully kept away from him.
He is expected to bring to the companion of his life a
body in robust health, and a soul untainted by pollution.
They select for him a youthful maiden of birth equal to
his own, of unspotted reputation, and, if possible, of great
beauty. It is the women of the family who ascertain these
points, being permitted to examine the tents in which
dwell young girls of marriageable years. A betrothal
takes place, followed in due time by the wedding.</p>

<p class='c010'>The first of these days of festival, which like those at
the birth of a child, last for some time, is called <i>nahr
refoude</i>, or the day of the rape. Four or five hundred
horsemen, magnificently attired, riding their finest
horses, carrying their most valuable arms, and conducted
by the kinsmen of the bride, proceed to the tent of the
latter. They are accompanied by women closely veiled
and mounted on camels and mules. The youngest and
most beautiful damsels of the tribe are chosen for this
joyful mission. The journey, which sometimes lasts three
days, is one continual fantasia. The horsemen gallop
to and fro, there is a constant discharge of fire-arms, and
the women utter that long drawn cry of love and joy
which fills the heart of the children of the desert with
ineffable emotion. At the arrival of this triumphal
procession, the father of the bride comes forth and
exclaims "You are welcome, O guests of Allah!" Then
<a id='Page_346'></a>follow banquetings and rejoicings until the morrow,
when they again set out. This time the bride forms one
of the cavalcade, mounted on a camel, or mule, richly
caparisoned. She has taken no leave of her father. An
almost false sense of delicacy forbids her to appear in his
presence at a moment when her fate is about to undergo
an entire change. She is equally prohibited from seeing
her elder brothers. Her girlhood's life is finished.
Henceforth she belongs to another family.</p>

<p class='c010'>When she is on the point of starting, her mother
tenderly embraces her and says: "You are going away
from those from whose loins you sprang. You are going
far away from the nest that has so long sheltered you,
and whence you issued forth to learn to walk, and that
in order to go to a man whom you know not, and to
whose society you have never been accustomed. I
advise you to be to him as a slave, if you wish that he
should be to you as a servant. Be satisfied with little.
Keep a constant watch over all that is likely to come
under his eyes, and let not his eyes ever behold an evil
action. See to his food and his sleep. Hunger causes
anger, the want of sleep produces ill humour. Take
care of his property. Treat his kinsfolk and slaves
with kindness. Be dumb as to his secrets. When he
rejoices, show no signs of sorrow. When he is sorrowful,
show no signs of joy. Allah will bless you!"</p>

<p class='c010'>While this nuptial journey is being accomplished, the
bridegroom prepares a tent richly ornamented, which he
places under the safeguard of some of his friends. Into
this the bride enters with her mother and female relatives.
A choice banquet is presented to her, and outside
a festival is celebrated, which, with gunpowder and
<a id='Page_347'></a>music, combines all that enters into the desert notion of
rejoicing. At ten at night the husband glides into the
tent, now silent and deserted.</p>

<p class='c010'>A wedding feast is often prolonged over three days
and nights, and is repeated each time the husband takes
a fresh wife. An Arab chief is permitted by the law to
have four wives at the same time, but even these do not
suffice for the gratification of these fickle and voluptuous
temperaments. It is in vain that, by a custom which
recalls to mind Biblical manners, a Mussulman husband
is allowed to associate concubines with his legitimate
wives. Even this tolerance is insufficient, and recourse
is had to divorce to appease these insatiable and ever
craving appetites. Instances have been known of an
Arab chief having had a dozen to fifteen lawful wives.
As may easily be imagined, peace is far from reigning
in households where the law recognizes the existence of
such elements of discord. Sometimes the tent is divided
into two parts, one chamber being exclusively reserved
for the women, the other belonging to the husband, who
selects from among his wives the one he fancies for that
night. Terrible jealousies secretly spring into being,
and, gradually gaining strength, finish by an explosion.
Frequently a wife who is preferred to her fellows is seized
with a mysterious illness, under which she languishes,
fades away, and dies—a poison prepared by a rival's
hand has passed into her veins. This is the gloomy
side of eastern manners—crime allying itself to lust.</p>

<p class='c010'>The immense part played by wives in the life of the
Mussulmans is shown by the following fact. Tell an
Arab that he is a coward, he will submit to the insult—if
he is a coward, it is the will of Allah that it should be
<a id='Page_348'></a>so. Call him a thief, he will smile; for in his eyes a
theft is sometimes a meritorious act. But address him
as <i>tahan</i>—a word which the language of Molière could
alone translate with concise forcibleness—and you will
kindle in his breast a fury that blood only can extinguish.
The only man whom an Arab will never forgive is one who
can with truth cast in his teeth that ill-omened epithet.</p>

<p class='c010'>After marriage the noble of the desert enters upon a
new life, and upon a sphere of individual action. He is
now emancipated, though not in an absolute fashion
unless he is the head of the tent, and master of his own
goods and chattels, or if his father is still alive. However,
even under these circumstances, he henceforth
counts among his tribe as a man of action and of
counsel, and by accumulated experience he will put the
finishing touch to his training as a great lord, thus far
sketched out by the habit of seeing good examples and
hearing good advice. Already he has his own clients,
his own horses, his own greyhounds, his own falcons,
and all the equipments for war and the chace. His
clients are young men of his own age, the courtiers of
his future eminence. His horses have been chosen from
among those that bring good fortune, and of the best
authenticated descent. His greyhounds have been fed
on dates crushed in milk, and on the kouskoussou of his
own meals. They have been broken in by himself; and,
while the vulgar dogs of the tribe bark all night at the
hyænas and jackals, they lie couched at his feet,
beneath the tent, and even upon his very bed. His
falcons have been reared under his own eyes by his own
falconer, and he himself has taken care to accustom them
to his cry on throwing them off and on calling them
<a id='Page_349'></a>back. Among his hunting and warlike equipments
there are guns from Tunis, or Algiers, damascened and
mounted in silver, the stocks incrusted with coral or
with mother of pearl—sabres from Fez with scabbards
of chased silver—and saddles embroidered in gold and
silk on a groundwork of velvet or morocco leather. To
complete his accoutrements, I may mention the sabretache
ornamented with panther's skin, plated spurs
incrusted with coral, the <i>medol</i>, or high-crowned broad-brimmed
straw hat, with a plume of ostrich feathers, and
the <i>malhazema</i>, or cartridge-box of morocco leather
pinked with silk, gold, and silver.</p>

<p class='c010'>At some future days when his father has paid "the
contribution levied by Allah on every head," that
spacious tent will be his, with all its luxurious furniture,
carpets, pillows, jewel-bags, silver cups, and supplies of
arms, ammunition, and food for the whole family,
consisting of from twenty-five to thirty individuals,
including master and servants. His, also will be that
stallion and those mares picketed in front of the tent,
those eight or ten negroes and negresses, those stores of
wheat, barley, dates, and honey prudently placed beyond
all danger of a <i>coup de main</i> in a town or village of the
desert, those eight or ten thousand sheep, and those five
or six hundred camels scattered over the grazing ground,
in the care of shepherds who follow their wanderings.
His fortune may then be estimated at from twenty-five
to twenty-six thousand <i>douros</i> [nearly £6,000].</p>

<p class='c010'>At the age, however, at which we parted from him,
that is, at eighteen or nineteen, he will have no need as
yet to trouble himself about the management of this
fortune. At present, he is merely a man of pleasure.
<a id='Page_350'></a>In time of peace, he goes forth on horseback, accompanied
by his friends and followed by his attendants mounted
on camels, who hold his greyhounds in leash or even
carry them on their saddle-bow, and proceeds to the
distant pasturages to inspect his flocks, taking advantage
of the opportunity to hunt the ostrich, or the gazelle,
or the <i>bekeur el ouhash</i>, according to the nature of the
ground and the season of the year. His leisure hours
will be especially devoted to the peculiarly aristocratic
and lordly pastime of hawking. These violent sports,
which I have already described, mould the nobility for
the toils of war and the razzia, to which these children
of the desert consecrate all the adventurous ardour and
energy that enter into their character.</p>

<p class='c010'>But as he advances in years, the Arab becomes more
sedate. Every white hair in his beard leads him to
thoughts of a religious nature. He more and more
frequents the society of the men of Allah, and loads them
with gifts; and more and more rarely he is seen at the
chace, at wedding feasts, and the fantasia. His occupations
as a chief leave him, besides, much less idle time.
He has to administer justice, increase his means, bring
up his children, and contract alliances. Nevertheless,
the chivalrous spirit of his youth is only slumbering
within him. Let the powder speak to redress an insult
offered to his tribe, he will not be the one to remain in
his tent. Too happy, he will say, to die like a man in
battle, and not like an old woman. Some great families
loudly boast that there is no tradition of any one of their
ancestors having died in his bed. If, however, he
escapes that coveted end, as soon as he feels the hand of
death upon him, he summons his friends to his bed-side,
<a id='Page_351'></a>for the presence of friends is desired at all the great acts
of human existence. "My brethren," he will say to
them if he be able to speak, "I shall never see you again
in this world; but I was only a pilgrim upon the earth,
and I die in the fear of Allah." He will then recite the
<i>shehada</i>, or symbolical act of the Mussulman faith:
"There is only one God, and Mohammed is the messenger
of God." If his lips refuse to pronounce these sacred
words, one of those present takes his right hand and lifts
up the forefinger. This sign, to which the dying man
adheres with all the energy still remaining in his earthly
tenement, is a testimony offered to the unity of the Deity.
After he has accomplished the <i>shehada</i>, he can die in peace.</p>

<p class='c010'>Funeral ceremonies are not wanting to the Arab chief,
especially to a warrior who has fallen in combating for
his tribe. He is wrapped in a white shroud, and exposed
to view on a carpet, the borders of which have been
turned back. The <i>neddabat</i>, that is to say, the women
who in the East replace the hired mourners of antiquity,
stand round the corpse, their cheeks blackened with
smoke, and their shoulders covered with tent-canvass, or
with camel-hair sacks. A few paces off, a slave holds by
the bridle the favourite mare of the deceased, and from
the <i>kerbouss</i> of the saddle hang a long gun, a yatagan,
pistols, and spurs. A little further off, the horsemen of
the tribe, old and young, in silent sorrow, sit in a circle
upon the sand, their <i>haiks</i> held up close to their eyes and
the hood of their burnous brought down over their brow.
The <i>neddabat</i> chaunt to a melancholy rhythm the
following lamentations:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c017'>
    <div>Where is he?</div>
    <div>His horse has come, but he has not come;</div>
    <div><a id='Page_352'></a>His sabre has come, but he has not come;</div>
    <div>His spurs are there, but he is not there;</div>
    <div>Where is he?</div>
    <div class='c001'>hey say that he died on his day, pierced to the heart.</div>
    <div>He was a sea of kouskoussou [generosity];</div>
    <div>He was a sea of powder;</div>
    <div>The lord of men,</div>
    <div>The lord of horsemen,</div>
    <div>The defender of camels,</div>
    <div>The protector of strangers.</div>
    <div>They say that he died on his day.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c021'>
    <div>THE WIFE OF THE DECEASED.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c017'>
    <div>My tent is empty,</div>
    <div>I am a-cold;</div>
    <div>Where is my lion?</div>
    <div>Where shall I find his equal?</div>
    <div>He never struck but with the sabre;</div>
    <div>He was a man for the dark days:</div>
    <div>Fear is in the <i>goum</i>.</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c017'>
    <div>He is not dead He is not dead!</div>
    <div>He has left thee his brethren.</div>
    <div>He has left thee his children;</div>
    <div>They shall be the bulwarks of thy shoulders.</div>
    <div>He is not dead! His soul is with Allah.</div>
    <div>We shall see him again some day.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>After these funereal lamentations, the <i>adjaïze</i>, or old
women, take possession of the body, wash it carefully,
place camphor and cotton in all the natural orifices, and
wrap it in a white shroud sprinkled with water from the
well of Zem-Zem<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c011'><sup>[96]</sup></a>, and perfumed with benzoin. Four
relatives of the deceased then lift by the four corners the
carpet on which it is laid, and take the road to the
<a id='Page_353'></a>cemetery, preceded by the Iman, the marabouts, and the
<i>tolbas</i>, and followed by the others. The former chaunt
in a grave manner: "There is only one God!" to which
the latter respond in chorus: "And our lord Mohammed
is the messenger of God!"</p>

<p class='c010'>For a brief space resignation soothes their despair.
Not a cry, not a sob, troubles these prayers offered in
common, these professions of the faith of the deceased,
which the pious assemblage repeats on his behalf. On
arriving at the cemetery, the bearers depose their sacred
burden on the edge of the grave, and the Iman, placing
himself by its side and surrounded by the marabouts,
recites with a strong sonorous voice the <i>salat el djenazat</i>,
or the burial prayer:</p>

<p class='c010'>"Praise to Allah who gives death and who gives life!</p>

<p class='c010'>"Praise to Him who raises up the dead!</p>

<p class='c010'>"To Him reverts all honour, all greatness. To Him
alone belong the commandment and the power. He is
above all!</p>

<p class='c010'>"Let praise be also to the Prophet Mohammed, his
kindred, and his friends! O Allah! watch over them and
grant them Thy mercy as Thou didst to Ibrahim, and
his, for to Thee belong glory and praise!</p>

<p class='c010'>"O Allah! N*** was Thy worshipper, the son of Thy
slave. Thou didst create him, and didst bestow upon him
the good things which he enjoyed. Thou, too, didst
take his life away, and Thou wilt raise him up again
from the dead!</p>

<p class='c010'>"Thou knowest his secrets and his innermost thoughts!</p>

<p class='c010'>"We come here to intercede for him, O Allah! Deliver
him from the horrors of the grave and from the fire
of Hell. Forgive him. Grant him Thy mercy. Grant
<a id='Page_354'></a>that the place he shall occupy be honourable and
spacious. Wash him with snow and hail water, and
cleanse him from his sins as they cleanse a white robe
from the impurities that have soiled it. Give him a
habitation better than his own, relations better than his
own, and a spouse more perfect than his own. If he was
good, make him still better. If he was wicked, forgive
him his wickedness, O Allah! He has taken refuge with
Thee, for Thou art the best of all refuges! It is a poor
man who has gone to share Thy munificence, and Thou
art too rich to chastise him and cause him to suffer.</p>

<p class='c010'>"O Allah! strengthen the voice of the deceased at the
moment when he shall render to Thee an account of his
actions, and lay not upon him more than he is able to
bear. We ask it of Thee through the intercession of Thy
Prophet, of all Thy angels, and of all Thy saints. <i>Amin!</i>"</p>

<p class='c010'>"<i>Amin!</i>" cry all who are present, at the same time
making a genuflection. Then the Iman resumes:</p>

<p class='c010'>"O Allah! Forgive our dead, our living ones, those
of us who are present, those of us who are absent, our
little ones, our great ones. Forgive our fathers, all those
who preceded us, and all Mussulmans!</p>

<p class='c010'>"Those whom Thou wilt bring to life again, bring to
life in the faith. And those among us whom Thou wilt
cause to die, let them die true Believers!</p>

<p class='c010'>"Prepare us for a good death, and may that death give
us rest, and the favour of beholding Thee. <i>Amin!</i>"</p>

<p class='c010'>This prayer being terminated, and while the <i>tolbas</i>
recite the <i>salat el mokteâat</i>, the body is lowered into the
grave, the face turned towards Mecca. Large stones
are fitted round it, and every one present makes it a
point of honour to throw in a little earth. The gravediggers
<a id='Page_355'></a>level the surface of the grave, and cover it with
thorny shrubs to protect it from hyænas and jackals.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is now time to return, and all retake the road to the
tribe with the exception of a few women, the friends or
relatives of the deceased, who, bowed down with sorrow
over the grave, speak to the dead man and question him
and wish him farewell, as if they thought he could hear
them. At last the <i>tolbas</i> and the marabouts exclaim:</p>

<p class='c010'>"Come, women. Retire trusting in Allah, and leave
the dead in peace to settle with Azrael;<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c011'><sup>[97]</sup></a> cease your tears
and lamentations. Death is a tax levied upon our heads.
We must all of us pay it. There is no alternative,
neither is there any injustice in this event. Allah alone
is eternal. What! should we accept the will of Allah
when it brings us joy, and refuse it when it brings us
sorrow! Depart. Your cries are an impiety."</p>

<p class='c010'>They understand these words, and with their hands
before their eyes they go forth from the cemetery, but at
every step turn round to renew their last adieus to him
whom they will never again behold until the day of
judgment. The foregoing funeral oration is pronounced
in the desert over every grave. The monotony of habit
is the handmaid of grandeur. If the Arab manners are
deficient in variety, they are at least solemn and
imposing.</p>

<p class='c010'><a href='#r10'>10</a>. What the Arabs understand by the evil eye is this: Some one may say
to you: "Oh! what a beautiful horse, what a beautiful mare you have
there!" Fear the worst from such a one, for he has only spoken out
of envy. If he had meant it in real kindliness, he would not have
failed to have added: "Allah protect you, or grant you his blessing."
It is not every one, however, who has the evil eye.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f11'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r11'>11</a>. Red and all the brilliant colours fall to the lot of good fortune,
in the eyes of the Arabs; while the sombre hues, and especially
yellow, indicate misfortune.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f12'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r12'>12</a>. The Arabs consider as green the colour we call a deep

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f13'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r13'>13</a>. The Arabs call blue the horse of a grayish colour shot

<div class='footnote' id='f14'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r14'>14</a>. It is a matter of luxury for the Arabs and especially for those of

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f15'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r15'>15</a>. The Arabs of the desert are so fond of their independent wandering

<p class='c010'><a href='#r19'>19</a>. When a desert tribe is at peace, the camels are sent away
ten or twelve leagues, to graze, and it may be easily conceived that
if a sudden swoop be made upon them it needs excellent horses and

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f20'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r20'>20</a>. Small and restless ears as well as lively and prominent eyes are

<div class='footnote' id='f21'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r21'>21</a>. The <i>mahari</i> is much more slender in its proportions
than the <i>djemel</i>, or common camel. It has the exquisite ears of
the gazelle, the supple neck of the ostrich, the hollow belly of the
<i>slougui</i> or greyhound. Its head is lean and gracefully attached to
the neck; its eyes bright, black, and prominent; its lips long and
firm, covering well the teeth; the hump is small, but the chest where
it touches the earth when the animal couches down, is strong and
protuberant; the dock of its tail is short; its legs, very lean in
the upper part, are furnished with muscles from the ham and the knee
down to the hoof, and the sole of its foot is neither broad nor thick:
finally, it has very few hairs on the neck, and its coat, of a tawny
colour, is as fine as that of the jerboa. See General Daumas' work on
the "Great Desert." In the desert, the <i>mahari</i> is to the

<div class='footnote' id='f28'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r28'>28</a>. The Tell is the granary of the Sahara: the master of the

<p class='c009'><a href='#r33'>33</a>. Among the Arabs of Upper Asia, but chiefly in the Nedjed, when a
filly is foaled, it is impossible to form an idea of the rapture
that seizes the family. "Allah has sent us a blessing; our lord
Mohammed has entered into our tent." Neither wives nor children would
suffer themselves to subtract one drop of the milk drawn from the
camels, the goats, and the ewes. The whole of it is reserved for the
fortunate foal, object of the love and most tender solicitude of all
inhabitants of the tent.  (<i>Voyage dans la Haute Asie</i>,

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f36'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r36'>36</a>. During my long career, in my tribes, by my friends, or
among my followers, I have seen upwards of ten thousand colts reared,
and I affirm that all those whose education was not begun at a very
early age and according to the principles enunciated above, have never
turned out other than stubborn, troublesome horses, unfit for war. I
also affirm that when I have made long and rapid marches at the head
of twelve or fifteen hundred horsemen, horses however lean, if early
broken in to fatigue, never fell out of the ranks, while those that
were fat or mounted too late have always fallen to the rear. My
conviction on this head is based on such a long experience that
lately, finding myself at Masseur (Cairo), in the necessity of
purchasing some horses, I refused point blank all that were presented
to me that had been broken in at a comparatively advanced age.</p>

<p class='c009'>"How has thy horse been reared?" was always my first question.</p>

<p class='c009'>"My lord," an inhabitant of the city would reply "this gray stone of
the river has been brought up by me like one of my own children,
always well fed, well tended to, and spared as much as possible, for
I did not begin to ride him till he was full four years old. See how
fat he is, how sound in all his limbs."</p>

<p class='c009'>"Well, keep him, my friend. He is thy pride and that of thy family.
It would be a shame to my gray beard to deprive thee of him."</p>

<p class='c009'>"And thou!" I would then ask of an Arab whom I recognized as a child
of the desert, so embrowned was he with the sun, "How has thy horse
been reared?"</p>

<p class='c009'>"My lord," he would answer, "betimes I formed his back to the saddle,
and his mouth to the bridle. With him I have reached a distant, very
distant point. He has passed many a day without food. His ribs are
bare, it is true, but if you encounter any enemies on your path he
will not leave you in peril. I swear it by the day of the last
judgment, when Allah shall be kadi and the angels witnesses."</p>

<p class='c009'>"Hola, there! tether the dark chestnut before my tent," I would cry
to my servants, "and satisfy this man."</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f38'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r38'>38</a>. "To-day we went out on horseback with our host
Youssouf-ben-Bender, and directed our course towards the desert. He
was accompanied by his sons and grandsons, all mounted on fine horses,
while his servants proceeded on dromedaries. During this excursion,
we met an Arab who caused me some surprise. Without saddle or bridle,
with a slight halter, the noseband of which was a thin iron chain,
and holding in his hand a wand crooked at one end with which he guided
his horse, he started off at full gallop, pulled up dead halt, was off
again like an arrow, turned sharp round at full speed, and while going
at that pace, made his horse change his feet, off the ground, on the
right line. I could scarcely believe my own eyes and I question if our
most celebrated riding masters or "sportsmen" could do better. What
particularly struck me was the simplicity of the means employed by this
son of Ishmael to obtain what he exacted from his courser. In Europe,
we study the functions and play of the muscles, only to counteract
them. In Arabia also are they studied, but in order to make use of
nature, not to do her violence. Besides, it is not merely one Arab
here and there who rides well; but all without exception are good
horsemen, all love the horse passionately, all understand how to
train him. At the bivouac an inhabitant of the Nedjed always sleeps
with his head resting on the shoulder of his horse, and every horse
lies down at his master's bidding. The latter thus obtains a pillow
softer than the ground, and also renders it difficult for any one to
steal his horse during his sleep." (<i>Voyage dans la Haute Asie</i>,
by M. Pétiniaud, General Inspector of the "Haras.")</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f39'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r39'>39</a>. While with us, in France, the stirrup is not supposed to bear more

whole weight of the body, when going at a good pace, is thrown
upon the stirrups.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f40'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r40'>40</a>. France was indebted to the hatred of Abd-el-Kader
cherished by Mustapha-ben-Ismaïl for the unfailing loyalty of the
illustrious chief of the powerful tribe of the Douairs. He had been
for upwards of thirty years the Aga of the Turks. Thus, when the son
of Mahi-Eddin, at the age of twenty-five, was proclaimed Sultan by the
tribe of the province of Oran, the aged warrior refused to yield
obedience to him, saying that "never with his white beard would he go
to kiss the hand of a mere boy." The consequences of this enmity forced
him to take refuge in the <i>mechouar</i> of Tlemcen, where for two
years he held out against the <i>hadars</i>, or citizens, all of whom
were devoted to the cause of him who had assumed the title of Commander
of the Faithful. Only when reduced to the last extremity did he demand
and obtain succour from Marshal Clauzel, whose column relieved him in
1836. From that period, notwithstanding his great age, he took part at
the head of the "goums" of the Douairs and the Zmelas, in all the
actions fought in the province of Oran. France recompensed this
energetic attachment by a Marshal's baton and the cross of a Commander
of the Legion of Honour. Mustapha-ben-Ismaïl was killed by the Flittas,
on the 19th May 1843, in his eightieth year, while skirmishing in the
rear, protecting the rich booty taken from the Hashem-Gharabas, at
the capture of the Smala.</p>

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f45'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r45'>45</a>. This plant is very common throughout Algeria, and is much

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
